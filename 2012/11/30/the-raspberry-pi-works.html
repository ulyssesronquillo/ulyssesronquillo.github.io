    <p>My <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspberry Pi</a> finally arrived yesterday, after what seemed like an eternity of waiting. I ordered it October 24. It was shipped November 20 and arrived on my doorstep November 29. That’s over a month! I had a few hours to play around with it. The first thing I did was placed the Raspberry Pi inside an <a href="http://www.adafruit.com/products/975" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adafruit Rainbow Pibow</a> enclosure that I’ve ordered several weeks back. It looks amazing. Here’s it is.</p>

<p><img src="http://uly.me/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/rpi.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once it was inside the Pibow enclosure, I downloaded the Raspberry image called <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raspbian Wheezy</a>. I loaded it to an old 4GB SD card that originally came with my Nikon D90 camera. Once the image was loaded, I inserted the SD card, connected a USB keyboard, a USB mouse, and a HDMI cable.</p>

<p>On a side note, I’m currently using a 5v 750ma USB adapter, which I know is sufficient, but the Raspberry Pi needs more ooomp with multiple USB devices connected to it. They recommend that you have at least a 5v 1amp power adapter.</p>

<p>Finally, I powered the Raspberry Pi. A blank screen! Not good. It turned out to be just a resolution issue. I ended up plugging my Raspberry Pi to my old TV, via a RCA composite cable. It worked, although a good portion of the screen was clipped. I started the GUI, then accessed the Terminal and changed the screen resolution from there.</p>

<p>I found this <a href="http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/1534/how-can-i-change-the-bash-screen-resolution-to-custom-values" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page</a> with instructions how to change Raspberry Pi to 1680×1050 resolution.</p>

<p>Edit the /boot/config.txt file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo nano /boot/config.txt
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Add the following code to the end of the file. 58 is for screens with a 1680×1050 resolution.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>hdmi_group=2
hdmi_mode=58
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Reboot.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo reboot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>My monitor works! All 1680×1050 pixels. I ran an update next by issuing the following commands.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This process takes a good 20 minutes. Finally, I installed Apache.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo apt-get install apache2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once installed. I checked if the web server works. It does.</p>
