    <p>The Buffalo Airstation <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/wireless/wireless-n-routers-access-points/airstation-highpower-n300-wireless-router-whr-hp-g300n/">WHR-HP-G300N</a> is a high-powered Wireless-N access point and router. It’s capable of transfer speeds up to 300Mbps. It operates at 2.4Mghz and comes with 4 Ethernet/Fast Ethernet ports. The firmware is powered by open-source DD-WRT.</p>

<p>So, I bought three Buffalo WHR-HP-G300N wireless routers for a client about a month ago hoping they would be a great addition to a list of reliable and stable access points that I will be maintaining. I ended up returning two of them due to issues with the signals that were dropping out after about a day or two.</p>

<p><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/whr-hp-g300n.jpg" alt="" title="whr-hp-g300n" /></p>

<p>I kept one router for testing purposes. I left the router running for about a week or so. I noticed that the wireless signal would disappear after about a day. I had to reboot the access point to get it working again.</p>

<p>I’m very disappointed about the wireless router being unstable. The wireless signals would disappear after a period of time. I went to Bufallo’s website and downloaded the latest driver. The page indicates that the latest firmware, although Alpha, V24SP2 17798 Alpha, is dated at Dec 5, 2011.</p>

<p>The firmware that came with my unit is the latest professional version, V24-SP2 build 17135, which is built on June 6, 2011, which is the one having all the issues. I had no choice but to try the latest version, although it is alpha.</p>

<p><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/firmware.png" alt="" title="firmware" /></p>

<p>Suffice to say, after the firmware upgrade, the wireless signal has been stable. No drops. No reboots needed. The WHR-HP-G300 has been running for almost a week now. It seems that Buffalo has fixed the issues with the signal drops.</p>

<p>If you’ve purchased the Buffalo Airstation WHR-HP-G300N and you are having issues, you might want to consider upgrading to the latest firware, <a href="http://www.buffalotech.com/support/downloads/airstation-highpower-n300-wireless-router-whr-hp-g300n/">V24SP2 17798 Alpha</a>, dated Dec 5, 2011.</p>
