    <p>It’s a new year, and it’s a good time to make a new start. I did a little bit of housekeeping work within WordPress, to make sure that my blog is off to a good start. I just <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/2012/01/01/a-new-theme/">changed theme</a> today. That’s going very well. While browsing around my blog, I noticed that the time on my posts are off by one hour.</p>

<p>It doesn’t make any sense, since my webhost is Hostgator, which is based in Houston, which is in the Central timezone. I’m in California which is Pacific timezone. My blog, for some reason, seems to be in the middle, in the Mountain timezone. I did some little investigative work and found that my WordPress timezone settings has changed.</p>

<p>This post is about making sure that your WordPress timezone is set correctly. So, login to your Admin Dashboard. Access Settings &gt; General look for the Timezone settings. See snapshot below. <img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/timezone.png" alt="" title="timezone" /></p>

<p>Select your timezone correctly. I set mine to UTC-8 for the West Coast of the United States. If you don’t know where you are, you can check several <a href="http://www.ramairskyways.com/HTML/Time_Local_UTC.html">websites</a> that offer timezone information. Once you made the change, go ahead and save. You can validate your WordPress timezone setting by looking at the internal clock next to the form. It should display the correct time in your timezone.</p>

<p><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/timezone2.png" alt="" title="timezone2" /></p>

<p>You should only get to do this once, but my time setting, for some reason has changed, and I just recently noticed it. So, make sure to check that your timezone is setup correctly.</p>
