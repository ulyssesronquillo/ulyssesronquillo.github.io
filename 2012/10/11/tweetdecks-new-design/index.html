    <p>Have you seen TweetDeck new design lately? I haven’t been using it for at least three years. Just wondering how it looks now, since Twitter has acquired TweetDeck in May of last year. I heard the creator and developer of TweetDeck, Iain Dodsworth, has received $40-$50 million dollars for selling his company to Twitter.</p>

<p>TweetDeck still looks familiar. The multi-column design is still there. You can easily switch back between the dark and light designs, which is a great idea by the way. Some people like white backgrounds. Some people like dark backgrounds. Adding columns is very easy. You can practically add anything to each column.</p>

<p>You can add timelines, home, interactions, mentions, search, lists, trends, messages, favorites, activity, inbox, scheduled, @mentions and @me to any column that you desire. Sorting the columns is very easy. Simply click on the left and right arrows when you are adding or editing a column. The column will automatically slide left to right.</p>

<p>The only complaint I have is, I wished TweetDeck would have a responsive design. I would love to see TweetDeck be responsive to any screen size. Having six columns might look good in a big monitor, but viewing it on smaller screen might involve moving the horizontal and vertical scrollbars.</p>

<p>Overall, I love the design. It’s very intuitive. You can easily add columns and customize content any way you want it.</p>
