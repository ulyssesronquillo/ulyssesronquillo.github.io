    <p>I saw Shrek 2 the other day. Thanks to my cousin who gave me the $2 passes. Now about the movie. Some critics touted the sequel to be better than the original, so my expections were unusually high. What could top the original Shrek?</p>

<p>The story begins after Shrek and Fiona return from their honeymoon. Fiona receives an invitation to visit her parents living at Far, Far Away Kingdom. Shrek refuses to go, but grudgingly accompanies his new wife.</p>

<p>Shrek receives a not-so-friendly welcome from the parents and their subjects who were expecting a handsome, normal prince and princess. The king, Fiona’s father, enlists the help of the not-so-fairy god-mother to pair up his daughter with the fairy god-mother’s son named Prince Charming, who purportedly is the only one that can lift Fiona’s curse.</p>

<p>Shrek steals the fairy god-mothers potion and drinks it, and becomes transformed to a brute, handsome and normal man. To cut the story short, Shrek and Fiona eventually get back together, but decide to live as ogres, and they live happily ever after.</p>

<p>The movie is surprising funny peppered with pop-culture jokes to keep the audience laughing and moving. As usual the donkey provided some laughs along with an array of small characters that included Puss-In-Boots, Pinocchio, Gingerbread man and the Three Little Pigs.</p>

<p>At times, the jokes were bordering corny, but is nicely done. Overall, a wonderful movie for a sequel. Now, why would Shrek and Fiona decide to live as ogres if they had a chance to live as normal human beings. Beats me.</p>

<p>They would have been happy either way. Or would they? If they decided to be normal, then no more Shrek! Another sequel perhaps? I hope not. Don’t ruin the streak. Shrek 1 and 2 is enough. Somehow, I can’t picture little Shreks and Fionas running around the house.</p>
