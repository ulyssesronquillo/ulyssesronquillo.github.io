    <p>I recently started looking into Fuel PHP. As much as I love CodeIgniter, it’s far from perfect. I’m more than curious if Fuel PHP can offer anything new to a glut of PHP frameworks that is already out there. There is Zend, CakePHP, CodeIgniter – which is my current favorite at the moment, and now Fuel. I was introduced to Fuel because some of the main supporters of CodeIgniter are now working with Fuel.</p>

<p>Here are some details from Fuel’s website.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fuel is a simple, flexible, community driven PHP 5.3 web framework based on the best ideas of other frameworks with a fresh start.</p>

  <p>The framework was started in late 2010 by <a href="http://dhorrigan.com/">Dan Horrigan</a> then shortly after the team grew to include <a href="http://philsturgeon.co.uk/">Phil Sturgeon</a>, <a href="http://jelmerschreuder.nl/">Jelmer Schreuder</a> and <a href="http://wanwizard.eu/">Harro Verton</a>. The team has decades of PHP experience between them and have all been involved with Open-Source projects such as CodeIgniter, <a href="http://pyrocms.com/">PyroCMS</a>, ExciteCMS and DataMapper ORM to name but a few.</p>

  <p>April 1st, 2011 was the date of the first feature frozen Release Candidate, marking Fuel as ready to be used for development of new projects. v1.0 final is not yet ready but the only changes will be bug-fixes.</p>
