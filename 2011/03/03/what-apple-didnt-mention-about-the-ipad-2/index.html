I wholeheartedly agree with Chris Taylor. The original article at Mashable is here. If a new feature of the iPad 2 was worth mentioning, then it would have been brought up by Steve Jobs. But, the omission of certain features was very telling. It meant those features that Jobs did not elaborate on are essentially the same as the previous iPad. I broken down those the iPad 2 features with fanfare, no fanfare and similar specs." />

<p>Engadget has a nice article comparing the <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/02/ipad-2-vs-original-ipad-whats-changed/">iPad vs. iPad 2</a>. Here is another comparison from <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/hardware/ipad-vs-ipad-2-whats-changed/11725">ZDNet</a>. If you are looking for bargain, Apple will be selling the original iPads for $399 while supplies last. That’s $100 off the original price. If you want the new one, it will be available March 11. It’s March 25 outside of the US.</p>
