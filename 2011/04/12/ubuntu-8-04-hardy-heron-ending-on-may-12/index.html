<meta name="description" content="Ubuntu will stop supporting Ubuntu 8.04 aka Hardy Heron on May 12th. That means no software updates and no security fixes for this old favorite. Hardy Heron was one of my favorite Ubuntu releases ever. I was with Hardy Heron for more than a year, mainly because it was very stable and had long term support. I continued to use Hardy even when 8.10 and 9.04 were out. I’m using Ubuntu 10.04 LTS now. Like they say, all good things come to an end. We will miss you, Hardy. Ok, now to Ubuntu 11.04. What’s up with this Unity interface?" />
