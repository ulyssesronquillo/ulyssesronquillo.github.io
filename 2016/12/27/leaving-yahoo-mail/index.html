    <p>Yahoo Mail has been hacked numerous times the last couple of years leaving me with no recourse but to abandon it. Iâ€™ve used my Yahoo account for years, signing up on just about everything that had a presence online. So, it was extremely important for me that I stop using Yahoo Mail for my security.</p>

<p>Over the last couple of months, I have been slowly switching my online accounts over to another email. The migration has been slow and an arduous process. It took me roughly a couple months to complete the migration. Hereâ€™s how I did it.</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, I cleared all spam.</li>
  <li>I then deleted all emails that were not important to me, including what was in the Send folder.</li>
  <li>I compiled a list of important websites that had my Yahoo account.</li>
  <li>I logged in to those sites and changed them to my new email address.</li>
  <li>I kept all the important email messages and placed them on a couple of folders.</li>
  <li>I then archived them and secured them to a local drive.</li>
  <li>I then deleted all the remaining messages on my Yahoo account. It now has zero messages.</li>
  <li>However, the account is still active. I need it for my Yahoo Fantasy Football. ðŸ™‚</li>
  <li>Occasionally, I still get email, but nothing of anything important.</li>
</ol>
