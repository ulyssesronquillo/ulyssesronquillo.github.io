    <p>For those of you who own a Xbox 360, you probably have at least one scratched disk rendering it unplayable. It’s a well-know issue within the Xbox 360 community. Thousands of users have lost money due to the damaged disks. In 2007, a class action suit was filed against Microsoft. Microsoft continues to fight, and even had the case dismissed a few years back, stating that there were not enough complaints to warrant such a case. From <a href="http://kotaku.com/supreme-court-to-hear-microsofts-appeal-of-xbox-360-dis-1753404391">Kotaku.com</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_SUPREME_COURT_XBOX_SCRATCHED_DISKS?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2016-01-15-16-20-59">an AP report released on Friday</a> (via <a href="http://www.polygon.com/2016/1/16/10779014/xbox-360-disc-scratching-lawsuit-supreme-court-class-action">Polygon</a>), a federal judge dismissed the class action suit in 2012, stating there were not enough complaints to justify a class action suit. Shortly after the dismissal was reversed by a federal appeals court.</p>

  <p>And so this past Friday the Supreme Court of the United States of America agreed that they would hear Microsoft’s last attempt to shake the class action lawsuit. The company wants to argue that since individual claims from defendants in the class action had been thrown out previously, the group claim should as well.</p>

  <p>The Supreme Court will rule over whether or not Microsoft has to face the class action suit. Should their decision come back in the plaintiffs’ favor, we’ll check back in another five years or so to see how it’s going.</p>
