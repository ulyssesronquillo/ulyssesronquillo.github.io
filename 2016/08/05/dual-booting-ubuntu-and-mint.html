    <p>I’ve been using the Mac OS for six years now. Prior to that, I was an Ubuntu user for 10 years. I do miss working with Linux. Part of the reason I switched, I was tired of constantly fixing the Ubuntu desktop. Every time there was a new release, something was broken and I needed to fix it. Then Ubuntu Unity desktop came along. That essentially was the last straw. I dabbled with Mint a little bit, but it only lasted for a couple of months.</p>

<p>These past few months, I’ve been trying to rekindle my love for Linux. I’m trying out two distros. I’m running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Linux Mint 18, dual booting each distro sharing a 1TB hard drive. Each distro is taking up 500GB. Both are running the Cinnamon desktop. There are a few issues here and there. It’s not quite the polish product yet. On both instances, I had to install the Chromium browser because Firefox, the default browser, is not just up to snuff.</p>

<p>Overall, Ubuntu and Linux Mint have improved tremendously since I last used them. The Sound and WiFi network settings are much, much more easier to configure than the previous iterations. If you were ask me which distro do I prefer now, I can’t give you an answer at the moment. Time will tell. It’s going to take a while to get used to navigating and using the Cinnamon desktop effectively. Maybe a follow up post is in order.</p>
