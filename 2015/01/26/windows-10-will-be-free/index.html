<meta name="description" content="Microsoft announced today that Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for Windows 7 and 8 users. I guess it means free updates as well. It doesn’t make sense to charge customers for bug fixes. So, why is Microsoft giving away a huge part of their revenue? Maybe, it has learned from the Windows Vista experience. Remember when Vista users had to buy Windows 7 to upgrade to a much more stable environment. Many people don’t seem to like Windows 8. That’s why Microsoft came out with Windows 10 right away, to make a right of the wrong. Charging for Windows 10, would have made people think twice before opening up their pockets." />
