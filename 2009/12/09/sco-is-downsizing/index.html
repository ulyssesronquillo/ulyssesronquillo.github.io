    <p>SCO is downsizing according to <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20091207202607649">Groklaw</a>. It’s not nice to be gleeful with someone else’s demise, but in SCO’s case, we will make an exemption. If they turn it around and make a contribution to the Linux community, maybe we will give them a reprieve. But, don’t expect SCO to change their suit happy ways. They are burning cash faster than money thrown in a bonfire. Anyways, here’s an excerpt from Groklaw.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SCO is downsizing. Ch. 11 Trustee Edward Cahn has filed a motion for the sale, transfer or abandonment of certain  <em>de minimis</em> assets. They have also signed a new lease with Canopy, and they hope the court will approve it. The new lease with Canopy is for space more than 50 percent smaller than where they’ve been. So, no more feet on that huge desk in Darl’s office. Remember <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,595047068,00.html">that picture</a>? Ah, yes, 2004. The bogo accusations. I call them the Bogo Years.</p>

  <p>SCO was in a space measuring 11,480 square feet and paying $22,715 a month for rent and other charges. Now they signed a lease this month for 4,365 square feet for $9,850 a month. The lease is attached as Exhibit A. So SCO is getting smaller and smaller.</p>

  <p>Seriously. Don’t abandon a thing. Put it on eBay, for real. A lot of geeks will pay you for Darl’s swivel chair and pen holder. Dibs on the computer. I’m not a bit kidding. Talk about flax into gold. You shouldn’t turn your back on this fabulous opportunity.</p>
