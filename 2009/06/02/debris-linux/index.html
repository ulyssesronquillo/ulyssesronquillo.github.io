    <p>The word debris means the remains of something broken down or destroyed or something that is discarded or rubbish. It certainly is an interesting name for a Linux distribution. <a href="http://debrislinux.org/">Debris Linux</a> boasts it will run on old or possibly discarded hardware. Here’s a excerpt from from Distrowatch about the Debris distribution:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The name Debris Linux first appeared in May 2007. Prior to that the distro was known as BeaFanatIX (BFX). Debris Linux 1.0, the first stable release under the new name, was announced on April 5th, 2008 and was based on Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon). Debris Linux is a live CD with a custom installer called DebIthat supports traditional hard drive installations or the creation of a live bootable USB stick using a frugal installation similar to Damn Small Linux. The distribution fits on a single ISO image that is always less than 200 MB, allowing Debris Linux to fit on a mini (3″ / 8cm) CD, despite providing a completely functional GNOME desktop.</p>

  <p>The goals for the distro include keeping it small, compact, and keeping hardware requirements as modest as possible to allow Debris to run well on older hardware. Recommended system requirements are a Pentium II or better processor, 128 MB RAM, and 2 GB of hard disk space. A fully installed system takes up just 850 MB of disk space, making Debris ideal for low-end or first-generation netbooks and nettops with 2 or 4 GB of SSD storage as well as legacy systems with storage limitations. In many ways Debris Linux is to Ubuntu what distributions like Slax and Wolvix Cub are to Slackware. A relatively small but active community has grown around the distro and there is an active user forum.</p>
