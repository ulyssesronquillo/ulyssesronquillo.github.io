    <p>It’s time to make New Year’s resolution. What’s yours? Lose more weight, stop smoking or keep up with finances. Whatever they may be, some of us try to make resolutions every year. According to a television network poll, 38% of the people did not make their resolutions at all last year. What? People have given up already?</p>

<p>If you made resolutions, then it’s important resolutions be practical. Solving world peace for example is a noble cause, but certainly would not be accomplished in a year by yourself. New Year’s resolutions often involves changing old habits. This is the most difficult aspect of following resolutions.</p>

<p>Let’s take losing weight for example. Losing weight usually involves exercise and changing eating habits. If you don’t like exercise or have difficulty changing your eating habits, then losing weight is going to be a tough resolution for you. You have to be practical. What can you do? You might not be able to lose 50 lbs you want or look like Adonis at the end of the year, but losing 5 lbs for example is a win in my book.</p>
