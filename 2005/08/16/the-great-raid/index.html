    <p>I saw the movie The Great Raid last night. In my opinion, it’s one of the most accurate movie depictions of the war in the Pacific. The movie was set in the Philippines in January 1945. It’s about a daring rescue of 500 American POWs in the Cabanatuan camp 30 miles deep in Japanese territory by the 6th Army Ranger Battalion. To this day, it’s still the most successful rescue in US military history.</p>

<p>The movie portrays the Japanese brutality, POW camps, the Philippine guerilla movement, a textbook about military planning and several references to faith. The movie is based on a book called “Ghost Soldiers.” The movied did well to stick to historical accuracy. In the end, I can’t help but feel good about the movie as waves of patriotism and pride overwhelm me. This movie was of particular interest to me since it was set in 1945 Philippines, although filmed in Australia.</p>

<p>Disappointingly enough, the movie is not critically acclaimed by movie critics since the actors are not on Hollywood’s A list. I agree the movie seemed to drag at times, but the ending of the great raid was well worth the wait. I recommend it. It’s a much better choice than Dukes of Hazard who had 3 more theatres compared to just one at my local cinema. Some people just don’t get it. Ok, I get it. Jessica Simpson.</p>

<p>I’m still curious as to why this movie was shelved for almost two years before being released by Miramar. And why couldn’t they use “Ghost Soldiers” as the title of the movie. Beats me. Anyways. see it! It’s worth every dollar, actually $10 for me.</p>
