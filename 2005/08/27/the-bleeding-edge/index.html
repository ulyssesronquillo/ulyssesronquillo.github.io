    <p>Well, after a couple of hours fighting <a href="http://gallery.menalto.com">Gallery</a>, I managed to get it back online yesterday. I upgraded Gallery several weeks ago, but I didn’t bother checking how it looked like on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/default.mspx">Internet Explorer</a>. The menu border was missing and the fonts were out of whack. How can Gallery looks so good in <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a> and be horrible in IE? Are the two browsers really that far apart? Something’s wrong. I checked the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS</a> file to see if it needed tweaking. No luck there. It dawned on me. It was the Gallery upgrade several weeks ago.</p>

<p>So, I backtracked to an older version of Gallery. I used FTP to upload the files, but it didn’t work. I think my FTP client ignores writing over newer files. As a result, my Gallery files were completely out of whack. I ended up with a hodgepodge or multiple versions of Gallery in one directory. I ended up deleting everything except for the albums folder. Just a word of caution: don’t delete the albums folder or say goodbye to your pictures. After a couple of hours tweaking Gallery, I managed to get it working again. I checked how it looked like in IE. So far, so good.</p>

<p>Then comes the customization part. I added a html wrap to both header and footer, so that Gallery will look like it’s part of my current theme in <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>. I checked Internet Explorer once again and wala, everything is working once again.</p>

<p>Lessons learned.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Always check cross functionality between browsers: Firefox, IE, etc.</li>
  <li>Delete everything when downgrading software, but backup the important files.</li>
  <li>If it aint broke, don’t mess around with it. A minor upgrade turned out to be several hours of work.</li>
