    <p>I went to Linux World 2005 Exhibition today. The usual big companies were there like HP, Sun, IBM, AMD, Oracle and Sybase. Linux giants Redhat and Novell were also present along with a few companies with smaller Linux distributions.</p>

<p>I was a bit disappointed since I expected a bit more. Missing were the popular Slackware, Debian, Gentoo, FreeBSD, TurboLinux and Mandriva companies. Where are you guys? It was nice to see MySQL. I expected a bit more Linux gadgets, but there were few and far between. The big companies clearly dominated the Linux World Exhibition. They had the largest and best spots on the floor.</p>

<p>There were a few surprises. I learned about a couple of distributions that are now open source, Sun’s <a href="http://opensolaris.org">opensolaris.org</a> although not entirely new and Novell’s <a href="http://opensuse.org">opensuse.org</a> who recently announced plans to open up SuSe. I plan to give both a try. There’s also an application called ActiveGrid, a rapid web application development program.</p>

<p>Goodies? Red-hat was passing out you guessed it, red hats, baseball hats to be exact. After lunch, Redhat up the ante by providing free chips and beer. HP gave me a pedometer for sitting in their “cluster” talk. I also won an HP leather portfolio for paying attention to the presentation. Ok, it was lucky guess on my part. I was halfway asleep in the presentation.</p>

<p>Sun had 10 workstations running Unreal Tournament. I wanted to jump in and join the fracas. Free magazines were everywhere: Linux Journal, Linux Magazine, Linux World Magazine and Open Source Journal. Last but not least, I saw Wonder Woman and an incredible looking babe at Pogo Linux. Sigh!</p>
