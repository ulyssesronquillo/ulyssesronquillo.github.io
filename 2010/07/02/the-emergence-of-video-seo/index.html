    <p>Video SEO is like website search engine optimization, but it is all about your video submissions to the online social video sites. If you are not using video to promote your business online, then you are missing out on a lot of extra sales. Videos are soon replacing the way most people look for information on the internet.</p>

<p>When you upload you video, think about your content, your meta data, your video promotion, and your community. When you consider these four categories when you create and submit your videos you will increase your chance for a first page search results ranking. Your objective is to not be buried under all the other video submissions.</p>

<p>Did you know that the average online video site receives twenty hours of video submission per minute? You see now why you have to optimize your video submissions. Content is the most important part of the optimization process. But do not expect to create one video and control the search rankings.</p>

<p>Meta data is not as important as the other factors in your video optimization, but it is a factor. If you have a video with great content and effective Meta data, you have a key to success. If you have on the other hand, a video with mediocre content, but great Meta data, you will not rank high on the search result pages. Meta data refers to the title of your video, your video description, and video tags.</p>

<p>On the other hand, promotion of your video is critical. One way to promote your videos is to use social networking online sites. You can build your following and then send out messages to your followers that you have uploaded a new video, one that they will find valuable.</p>

<p>Your video will be ranked higher when you build a community. Build a brand by creating a profile video home page so people can find your other videos quickly by going to one web page on the video website. This takes more effort, but your site will be more organized and your videos will be ranked higher.</p>
