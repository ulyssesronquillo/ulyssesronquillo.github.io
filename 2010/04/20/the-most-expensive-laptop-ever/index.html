    <p>When I saw the article of the <a href="http://www.criticalcold.com/?p=1">most expensive laptop ever</a>, at first thought, it was a 17-inch MacBook Pro bought by the US government at a deep discounted price of $100,000. Then, I realized I was wrong. This particular MacBook is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>fitted with 25.5 carats of flawless diamonds. A total of 53 diamants individually set in a solid 24ct gold apple logo.</p>

  <p>The whole housing is made of highly polished solid 24ct gold. Weighing about 2600 grams this is certainly not the most portable macbook ever, but you have to be a little light in the head if you are willing to spend the stunning amount of 219,995.00 British pounds (about $339,826.00)</p>

  <p>The so called “piece of art” is available in a limited edition of 10 only, so if you feel the need and have the purchasing power: be quick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don’t like gold personally, you can go for Platinum.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For the less privileged among us there’s also a cheaper platinum edition, made out of platinum and aluminum. Also covered with flawless diamonds.</p>

  <p>The so called “piece of art” is available in a limited edition of 10 only, so if you feel the need and have the purchasing power: be quick.</p>

  <p>This one is available at “just” 139.995,00 British pounds. ($216.115,00)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s too bad only 10 of each is available, the Pentagon could have bought these babies at a discounted price of $1 million each. That would have sent Apple stock price through the roof.</p>
