    <div>Drupal, the popular web content management system, will release Drupal 7 later this year. Drupal project founder Dries Buytaert mentioned at DrupalCon in San Francisco that Drupal 7 will be a bit slower than Drupal 6. In Drupal 7, speed was sacrificed for scalability. It means more big sites can run Drupal, albeit a tad slow.

&gt; The upgrade to Drupal, meanwhile, could be available perhaps in the June timeframe or as late as September, said Drupal project founder Dries Buytaert in a presentation at the Drupalcon SF conference in San Francisco. Ideally, version 7 would be available this month, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Buytaert reflected on the emergence of Drupal as well as where it is headed. The immediate upgrade, Drupal 7, features 70 modules, including an image API, and a substantial growth in code size, said Buytaert.
&gt; 
&gt; Buytaert stressed the urgency of Drupal 7. “First of all, it’s very important that we get it out as soon as possible” to maintain momentum, he said.
&gt; 
&gt; Currently, Drupal powers about 1 percent of Websites, trailing WordPress, which runs about 8.5 percent of the Web, according to Buytaert.

I’ve tried Drupal once many moons ago. It was nice, but I didn’t think it was any better than WordPress.
