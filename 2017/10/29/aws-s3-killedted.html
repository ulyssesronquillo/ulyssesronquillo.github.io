    <p>I was trying to copy a large file from AWS S3 bucket to the smallest Amazon Lightsail instance using the AWS CLI. It was throwing out an error saying “Killedted 3.8 Mib/113.4 Mib (5.0 Mib/s) with 1 file(s) remaining.” For some reason, the copy was being killed or terminated. I was thinking that maybe the small instance was not enough to copy or move large files. I’m glad I found a <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/issues/1775" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">workaround</a>. Here’s the command I was doing, and the fix.</p>

<p>The Error</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ aws s3 cp s3://bucketname/directory/largefile.mp4 largefile.mp4
$ Killedted 3.8 MiB/113.4 MiB (5.0 MiB/s) with 1 file(s) remaining
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Fix</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ aws configure set default.s3.max_concurrent_requests 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The default is 10 which was too much for a small instance.</p>
