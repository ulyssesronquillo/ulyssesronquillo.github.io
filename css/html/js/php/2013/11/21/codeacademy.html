    <p>If you want to learn how to develop websites, visit <a href="http://codeacademy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodeAcademy.com</a>. In about several dozen exercises or so, you can quickly learn how to write code in different languages that empower the web. Courses in HTML/CSS, PHP, Javascript, Python, Ruby, and APIs are being offered. The program is geared towards people with no programming experience, but challenging enough for those with some programming experience.</p>

<p>The programs are designed to get you started, and to get your feet wet. It’s by no means a be all exhaustive programming experience. The CodeAcademy exercises are designed to get you introduced to the basics of each language. If you’re looking for a programming experience that is exhaustive, extensive and covers intermediate and advanced levels, CodeAcademy is not this program. There are other certification programs offered for a handsome fee.</p>

<p>CodeAcademy programs are free.</p>
