<meta name="description" content="I purchased a pancake lens from Viltrox. It’a 28m lens which is a 42mm equivalent on full frame. It comes with a fixed aperture at f4.5 with autofocus. It’s sharp in the center as well as in the edges. There’s a little bit of vignetting on the edges and some flare if you shoot at certain angles at the sun. It’s not quite up to par with the other Viltrox 27mm f1.2 that I own, but it’s super lightweight lens and easy to carry around. It’s perfect lens for street photography if you just want to snap pictures randomly without lugging a heavy lens." />

    <p>I purchased a <a href="https://viltrox.com/products/af-28mm-f4-5-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pancake lens</a> from Viltrox. It’a 28m lens which is a 42mm equivalent on full frame. It comes with a fixed aperture at f4.5 with autofocus. It’s sharp in the center as well as in the edges. There’s a little bit of vignetting on the edges and some flare if you shoot at certain angles at the sun. It’s not quite up to par with the other <a href="https://viltrox.com/products/viltrox-af-27mm-f-1-2-pro-xf-mount" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Viltrox 27mm f1.2</a> that I own, but it’s super lightweight lens and easy to carry around. It’s perfect lens for street photography if you just want to snap pictures randomly without lugging a heavy lens.</p>

<p>It does struggle a little bit with focusing. You may have to hold your camera steady for a few seconds to nail down the focus. Otherwise, it’s a fun little lens for just $99. I got mine at a discount at $79 that’s why I jumped at the chance. Since the lens is a fixed aperture at f4.5, it will struggle some at night. It’s not totally impossible. You just have to be steady. I’m so used to f1.2 that I forget sometimes other lenses are much slower.</p>

<p>So, give it a try if you are looking for portability. If you’re looking something more with a better quality lens and better focusing and less flare, try the other Viltrox lens that I own, which is the Viltrox 27mm f1.2. Just be mindful of the size and weight. I don’t mind at all. I took it to Europe for 2 weeks and I didn’t find it cumbersome.</p>
