    <p>I have two Github accounts. The first one was cloned using HTTPS. When it was time to add a second one, I really didn’t want to mess around with multiple Github accounts and dealing with multiple credentials. I’ve decided to just clone the second account using SSH. I decided to do this mainly to simplify setup and to avoid the headaches with setting up multiple accounts in the config.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First repo - was cloned using HTTPS</li>
  <li>Second repo - was cloned using SSH</li>
</ul>

<p>The first repo which uses HTTPS requires a github key which will need to be generated on Github. The first time a repo is cloned, you’ll be prompted to supply the key. This key is kept in the <strong>~/.git-credentials</strong> file on the local desktop. The second repo which uses SSH requires a ssh key to be generated locally on your desktop, which you will then need to upload to github to allow authentication.</p>

<p>So here we go. Two separate ways of cloning repos without stepping on each other.</p>
