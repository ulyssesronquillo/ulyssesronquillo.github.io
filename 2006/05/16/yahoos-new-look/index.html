<meta name="description" content="Here’s a preview of Yahoo’s new website. The leading internet portal has decided to rearrange its front page. What’s new? Well, the search bar is more prominent. The menu links are vertical and on the left side just like countless of other websites out there. The ad space is much bigger. I’m not a bit surprised about this move. Yahoo has to make money to pay the piper. The news section is much more compact and efficient especially with the use of tabs. The personal section employs a drop-down area for email, radio, messenger, weather, local and movies. You can actually see the last four emails from your inbox. Nice use of Ajax. You can also view the local weather in your city, find out who is online in messenger, view the movies playing in your area, etc. One positive is the screen size for the page is not so tall, so hardly any scrolling involve. Very compact. Overall, I like it. If I can only personalize the front page. Wait, there’s promise for this feature as well. I guess, I should really wait for the official launch sometime in the near future." />
