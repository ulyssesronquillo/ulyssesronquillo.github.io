<meta name="description" content="As I expected, my new iPod arrived today. I opened up the package and found a spanking new iPod with custom engraving on the back of the unit. Very nice. The 30gb white iPod came in an attractive little black box designed like a CD case. It came equipped with a regular white headset and a USB cable for charging and synching. The only thing not provided by Apple is an AC wall charger. Instead, you’ll need a computer with an USB port to charge the unit. Sucks. If you want a wall plug adapter, you need to shell out an additional $29 bucks. Other than that, I’m happy with it. I can’t wait to listen to some tunes." />
