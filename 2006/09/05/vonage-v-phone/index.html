<p><strong>Changed My Mind</strong></p>

<p>After inquiring about the V-Phone from Vonage, I found out that they require a second line for the V-Phone. The monthly costs for the second line is $24.99. The device itself costs $39 plus a one-time $29 installation. After hearing all of it from a customer representative, I decided not to pursue the product. I can justify spending $39 for the device, but not a second line with a monthly cost of $24 dollars. I wonder how many current Vonage customers are actually using this product. It’s an extra feature I can live without. The monthly cost stopped me dead on the track.</p>
