    <p>Have you ever lost a Start Menu? Well, I did today. It was my lucky day. So, I tried fixing it with every known fix to mankind (well, at least what’s posted on the forums), but to no avail. Worst, I also had a Taskbar Menu on my Desktop that just wouldn’t go away.</p>

<p>I was really getting sick of the PC problems I’ve been getting the past two weeks, that I’ve decided to obliterate everything on my laptop. First, I backed up my data. No problem. I used my USB drive. What a lifesaver! Everyone should get one. I don’t even know how people did backups in the past, but I heard it was a real mess.</p>

<p>After backing up my data. I came up with a list of applications that were installed on my PC. Wouldn’t you know it, I had over 100 applications installed. Did I use them all? No, only a handful. Some apps were already deleted, but they all left all kinds of orphaned files in the system.</p>

<p>I decided to come up with a list of applications that I absolutely must have. I came up with less than 10. Amazing. So, I created a special folder for the install software of these 10 applications I mentioned for easy access and for a quick restore later on.</p>

<p>Then came the moment of truth, formatting the drive. One of the nice things Fujitsu did was provide a restore CD. The restore image is the same image when the laptop came out of the factory two years ago. Simply an awesome utility.</p>

<p>After the restore, everything worked great. The desktop was “dejavu.” It’s the same image when I first bought it two years ago. Same software, same programs and same icons. I can’t believe how this laptop boots up fast. My computer had become bloated.</p>

<p>I then reinstalled all the essential programs. Then, I realized I forgot something. I forgot to save my bookmarks and address book in Mozilla Thunderbird, my email client. I can recreate the bookmarks, but I can’t recreate the address book. No big deal. I can search my inbox for people’s email addresses.</p>

<p>So, now I’m good. I now have a good working laptop, six hours later. Well, it was worth the time considering all the problems I have been getting these past two days. Now, I can rest assured it will be another two years before I do the same thing. By that time, my laptop would be obsolete.</p>
