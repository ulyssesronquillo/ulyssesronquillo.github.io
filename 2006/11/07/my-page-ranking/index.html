    <p>I currently have a <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">Google Page Ranking</a> of 6/10. It’s not bad considering most personal websites have a ranking of 0/10. So, how did I do it? Well, I must admit I didn’t have a grand plan. I just kind of stumbled into it. My page ranking started moving up when other <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> users started using my template called the <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/blackletterhead/">Black-Letterhead Theme</a>.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://technorati.org">Technorati</a>, I currently have <a href="http://www.technorati.com/search/http://ulyssesonline.com/?partner=wordpress">576 links from 342 blogs</a> as well as 694 total links to this URL. What this means is that more than two-thirds of the total links come from blogs alone. Most of it comes from people who are using the Black-Letterhead theme which includes a CSS file containing a link back to this URL. Finally, one more bit of information, Technorati provides its own ranking system and my website is at #7,595. I’m not sure what it means, but I’ll take it. Not bad.</p>

<p>As expected, <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo.com</a>, <a href="http://cnn.com">CNN.com</a> and <a href="http://msn.com">MSN</a> outranked me at 9/10. I’m not complaining at all. Getting a 6/10 from Google’s Page Ranking without any marketing is pretty awesome. I would like to add that one-third of the total links recorded were mostly likely from comments I made from other people’s blogs. This is the hard work.</p>

<p>So, that is the secret to having a page ranking of 6/10. I didn’t plan it. There was no grand scheme. It just something that fell on my lap. So, the Black-Letterhead theme delivers. It’s not the most popular theme by far, but it’s good enough to increase my page ranking to a level I never had imagined.</p>
