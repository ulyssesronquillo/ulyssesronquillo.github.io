<p>One of my petpeeves on a website is Google’s Adsense. Every blog and personal website seems to have a section dedicated to the Google links. Do people really make money from these links? Will someone tell me how much money people have made by having these links displayed on their blog. I have no idea. Is the advertising distraction worth it? Ok, everyone has a price. Would I do it for $2000 a year? Well, maybe. Come to think about it, I might do it to cover the cost of hosting. That’s only $120 annually, but Adsense is still a nuisance to me.</p>
