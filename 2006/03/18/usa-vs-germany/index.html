This is a tune-up game for the United States against this summer’s World Cup host country. The US will field a team mostly composed of MLS players since most of their European-based players were not released by their respected clubs since March 22 is not an official FIFA international match date. However, Germany will be at full strength. It’s will be Germany’s A Team against the USA’s B team. It will be interesting to see who wins the match since Germany recently suffered a 4-1 spanking from the Italians and the US defeated Poland 1-0 just two weeks ago." />
