    <p>If you use a product and don’t hear much about it, you’ve come to realize it does what it’s supposed to do. The product works transparently behind the scenes without any problems or hitches. And when it’s called upon to do something, it just takes care of the problem efficiently without a major incident.</p>

<p><a href="http://avast.com">Avast Antivirus Software</a> from Alwil Software is one of those products. I have been using their Home Free Edition Antivirus software for the last two years. It has been nothing short of wonderful. The software is non-obtrusive. That means you forget the software is running in the background. It’s effective. I haven’t had a virus problem in more than two years. And most of all, it’s free. You can’t beat that price anywhere else in the world.</p>

<p>When I first purchased my laptop a couple of years ago, it came with the <a href="http://symantec.com">Symantec’s</a> Norton Antivirus software. Based on my experience, the software seemed to just take over the control of my laptop like it had a mind of its own. I had problems running a few applications. The software was very active and it seemed to intervene with everything that I did. It was just out of control.</p>

<p>Buying licenses for the Norton Antivirus software was a sore subject to me. Don’t get me wrong. I would gladly play for a software as long as it works cleanly and efficiently. So, why should I pay for an inferior product if I can find a better one for free.</p>

<p>Alwil Software makes their money selling their Professional and Corporate Antivirus software to businesses and corporations while making it available for free to home users. If you haven’t tried Avast yet, give it a try. You can visit their <a href="http://avast.com">website</a> for more information.</p>
