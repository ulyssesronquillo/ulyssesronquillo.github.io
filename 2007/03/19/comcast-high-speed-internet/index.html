    <p>I love the speed of Comcast’s High Speed Internet connection. My latest internet speed test recorded a 15 mbps connection. It is lightning fast. It’s what I love about having a high speed internet cable connection. So, why am I blogging about it. There must be a problem. Yes, there is. The problem is <a href="http://www.comcast.com/">Comcast</a> has had it share of downtime this past month. I counted three so far. It could be more. The downtime usually takes anywhere from 2-6 hours.</p>

<p>It’s becoming to be a very frustrating experience. It’s not like the phone lines could be the issue when you have a DSL connection. This is cable! We haven’t had any interruption with our TV service. So, why can’t Comcast offer the same uptime with their internet connection. I hope they fix it soon. Yes, that’s you in Fremont, CA. I better pay the bill before I complain too much. Or maybe, I’ll wait until they can fix the problem.</p>
