    <p>I ordered the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/dp/B0045RMEPI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top">Obi110 from Amazon</a> last week. Today, it finally came. For those not familiar with the Obi110, it’s an analog terminal adapter (ATA), from <a href="http://obihai.com">Obihai Technology</a>. It allows you to use old analog phones to make free phone calls to anyone via the Internet using Google Voice.</p>

<p>With the Obi110, I can use Google Voice or any SIP service or provider such as Callcentric, Sipgate, Vitelity or Voip.ms to make phone calls anywhere. Any old analog telephone will work. There is no need for a computer or a softphone.</p>

<p>The Obi110 is a standalone device that’s connected to your home network. When you make a call, your call will be routed via your network and out to the internet. Pairing the Obi110 with Google Voice is ideal, since Google Voice allows you to make free phone calls to any landline or mobile phone in the United States or Canada.</p>

<p>When I received the device about an hour ago, all I had to do was register the device at Obihai’s website. I added Google Voice in the configuration. The setup was relatively easy. The Obi110 costs about $50.00. It’s one time fee. There are no monthly fees, no taxes, no surcharges.</p>

<p>Google Voice is currently free, until Google changes its mind. If you’re not convinced about Obi110, check out the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/OBi110-Service-Bridge-Telephone-Adapter/product-reviews/B0045RMEPI/ref=dp_top_cm_cr_acr_txt?ie=UTF8&amp;showViewpoints=1">great reviews</a> of this product at Amazon. In addition, here’s a couple of great Youtube videos for your viewing pleasure.</p>

<h4 id="obi110-review">Obi110 Review</h4>

<p>This is a great review of the Obi110 device. It contains all the info you need to familiarize yourself with the device. The reviewer doesn’t really start talking about the Obi110 until about 4:15. You can probably skip the first 4 minutes.</p>

<h4 id="how-to-setup-the-obi110">How to Setup the Obi110</h4>

<p>The Setup of the Obi110 was super easy. It’s intuitive. I didn’t even read the instructions. Less than 5 minutes later, I was making phone calls.</p>

<h4 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h4>

<p>I will probably cancel my Vonage and MagicJack subscriptions. Vonage is great, but not at $30 a month. I also have the old MagicJack model which I will not renew. The older MagicJack I have still needs a computer, plus it’s about $40 a year.</p>

<p>With Google Voice and the Obi110 ATA, my monthly phone service cost me nothing. The price is right, it’s zero, zilch, nada, as long as Google keeps their end of the bargain.</p>

<p>The real challenge is trying to port my Vonage number to Google Voice. It’s going to be a lengthy process to port my number. I have to port the Vonage number first to a wireless carrier, then port it again to Google Voice. I can’t port directly from Vonage to Google. Google charges $20 to port a wireless number.</p>
