    <p>There are many reasons why people upgrade their computers. It’s usually because the old hardware no longer works. Maybe it was simply too slow, or it doesn’t support any of the newer technologies. Whatever the case may be, people will usually end up with some old hardware that destined for donation or the scraps.</p>

<h4 id="run-linux">Run Linux</h4>

<p>Before you part ways with your old hardware, you should really consider holding on to it a little while longer. I recommend that you install Linux on it. Why? Why not. Linux is fun operating system that has been around for almost 20 years. It’s powerful, educational, and most of all, it can breathe new life into that old crusty hardware.</p>

<h4 id="which-distro">Which Distro?</h4>

<p>Linux comes in many flavors, which are called distributions, or distros for short. Which Linux distro is good for you? Well, it’s up to you. There are many, many to choose from. There are currently over 420 Linux distributions according to <a href="http://futurist.se/gldt/">GNU/Linux Timeline</a>. Most distros are active, with a few that are no longer supported.</p>

<h4 id="stick-with-the-popular">Stick With The Popular</h4>

<p><a href="http://debian.org">Debian</a>, <a href="http://ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="http://linuxmint.com">Linux Mint</a>, <a href="http://redhat.com">Redhat</a>, <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>, <a href="http://centos.org">CentOS</a>, and <a href="http://slackware.com">Slackware</a> are just a few of the more popular distros. I recommend that you start with these distros. They are popular, well supported, and have thousand of users willing to help. Get familiar with the respected support forums in case you have an issue or two.</p>

<h4 id="try-before-you-install">Try Before You Install</h4>

<p>Most popular Linux distros will give you the option to try before installing it. I suggest that download the ISO images from directly from the distro websites. You will be asked to create a Live CD or DVD from the images, where you can boot from and run Linux. If you don’t like it, move on to the next one, until you find a distro you are comfortable with.</p>

<p>If you found one you really like, install it. Frequent the support forums for tips, solutions, suggestions, etc. Update your distros to keep up with the latest security patches and developments. Most of all, enjoy Linux.</p>
