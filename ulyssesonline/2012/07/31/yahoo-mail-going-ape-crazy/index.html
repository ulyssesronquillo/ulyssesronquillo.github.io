    <p>I just tried checking my emails at Yahoo Mail, and it’s going ape crazy. It looks like the upgrade didn’t go over very well. That’s one thing the new CEO, Marissa Meyer needs to fix. Yahoo needs to have flawless execution when making upgrades, and especially to Yahoo Mail, where millions of users use it for business and personal reasons.</p>

<p>How many times do I have to accept the terms of service? Is five times enough? I hope Yahoo doesn’t lose my mail. That would be a disaster. This makes you think twice if you should rely on free email for your business. I wonder how many people really read Yahoo’s Terms of Service. I bet 99% of users don’t read it. I certainly didn’t.</p>

<p>Yahoo could have put anything in that agreement, and by law, I’m bound to it. I should really read it. You should, too. Come to think of it. It’s quite scary. I just love the fact, that you can check Twitter, if you’re not the only one having issues with something, because everyone and their mother is tweeting about it. Twitter, you’re awesome.</p>
