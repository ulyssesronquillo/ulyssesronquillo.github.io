    <p>So, I decided to get cute and changed my WordPress admin username to a username I wanted via a utility called phpMyAdmin. I went to the <strong>wp_users</strong> table and made a simple username change to the <strong>user_login</strong> field. I logged out and logged in back to the WordPress Dashboard. Disaster! I just lost both my WordPress admin and network admins rights. My former admin account has been reduced to a regular plebe. So, this is how a regular WordPress subscriber looks like.</p>

<p>It was a scary five minutes at WordPress land. I’m laughing now, but I wasn’t then. So, I went back to phpMyAdmin and also changed the <strong>user_nicename</strong> and <strong>display_name</strong> to the <strong>wp_users</strong> table hoping that would fix it. No cigar. Panic set in. After a few Google searches, I finally found the solution. Thanks to people who post their solutions online.</p>

<p>What a relief! First, you have to make sure you have the right <strong>user_id</strong>, especially if you have a multisite blog. Go to your <strong>wp_users</strong> table and make a mental note of your admin ID. It’s usually an ID of 1.</p>

<p>Next, I went to the <strong>wp_usermeta</strong> table and changed the <strong>wp_capabilities</strong> entry to <strong>a:1:{s:13:”administrator”;s:1:”1″;}</strong>. The key here is the entry <strong>s:13</strong>. My account was reset to <strong>s:1</strong> for some reason. I temporarily changed it to <strong>s:10</strong>, but it didn’t work. Setting it to <strong>s:13</strong> did the trick. It worked wonderfully.</p>

<p>Now, I’ve regained all the admin rights for each blog that’s on the network, except that I’ve lost the Network Admin. Well, another Google search. Thank you. To make the story short, I also had to edit the <strong>wp_sitemeta</strong> table. Look for the <strong>meta_key</strong> and change to <strong>a:1:{i:0;s:11:”yournewname”;}</strong>. The <strong>s:11</strong> is the length of “usernewname” which is 11.</p>

<p>That was the fix. Whew. A close shave. All in all, all is good once again at WordPress land. I am one happy admin. Just a bit on the adventurous side, but otherwise a happy camper. I’m posting this article because, I know some dufus admin in the future will probably do the same thing that I did. It wasn’t all that bad. It was just a little bit disconcerting when you lose all admin rights.</p>
