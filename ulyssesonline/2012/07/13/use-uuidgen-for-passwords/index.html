    <p>An impenetrable system is only as good as its weakest password. Computers systems are often attacked using brute force. Most users tend to use really simple and easy to guess passwords. The use of complex passwords on the other hand, makes it almost impossible for them to remember. That’s why passwords typically fall in the 6-8 character range.</p>

<p>For systems and applications, that don’t need human intervention, when communicating to databases and other systems, a much more complex password can be assigned. These passwords typically do not need to be typed-in on forms, so they can be long, difficult and outrageous. There’s a Linux utility called UUIDGEN which randomly creates and generates unique universal identifiers.</p>

<p>A typical output would be:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pre lang="php"&gt;
150152b0-cd0e-11e1-9b23-0800200c9a66
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These keys are perfect for systems and applications. For example, WordPress requires a username and password to talk to the MySQL database. The database credentials are typically stored in wp-config.php file. A key generated by UUIDGEN can be used in this scenario. This is just one example where long and difficult passwords can be deployed. They can be used for other purposes as well.</p>

<p>So, if you have access to a Linux system, to generate a unique key, all you have to do is type the command, “uuidgen” in the Terminal.</p>
