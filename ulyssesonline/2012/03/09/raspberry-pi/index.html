    <p>Watch out Apple, there’s another fruit in the market. Yesterday, I was ogling Apple’s TV which sells for just $99. That has to be one of the most affordable hardware sold by Apple. Except for the iPod shuffle, which sells for a mere $49. Which brings me to my main topic today, the Raspberry Pi, a full-fledged computer being sold for just $35. Did I hear that right?</p>

<p>The Raspberry Pi is powered by an Arm-based processor. It’s about the size of a credit card. It comes with a HDMI port, 2 USB ports for connecting keyboard and mouse, an audio output, a composite output for old-style TVs and monitors, an Ethernet port for the network, and a SD card slot for loading the operating system. It runs on just 2 watts of power, and it boots in less than 15 seconds.</p>

<p>The best part of it all, it runs on Linux, an open-source operating system. Since it’s open-source, you can do practically anything to it. Currently, there are 3 Linux distro images available for the Raspberry Pi. They are: Debian squeeze, Arch Linux ARM, and Fedora 14 Remix. There are many potential uses for the Raspberry Pi, such as a media center, cafe internet workstations, robotics, to name a few.</p>

<p>Finally, here’s a video of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>. Yea, I want one or two.</p>
