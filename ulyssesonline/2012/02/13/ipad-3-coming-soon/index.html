    <p>Rumors has it that the iPad 3 is just a couple of weeks away from being introduced by Apple. Several sources indicate the special release date is going to be March 7. Speculations indicate that the new iPad will have these new features: a retina display with a resolution of 2048 x 1536, a quad-core processor, a better camera on the front as well as in the back, and finally 4G LTE networking.</p>

<p>Now how accurate are these rumors? Nobody really knows. But chances are that one of these features will make it on the iPad 3 is pretty good. It may not be all the features mentioned above. However, it is possible that one or two unanticipated features will surface and catch everyone by surprise.</p>

<p>By the looks of it, the iPad will essentially be the same size and design, but it could be slightly thicker if the bigger battery rumors are true. We’ll just have to wait several weeks if the rumors are really true.</p>
