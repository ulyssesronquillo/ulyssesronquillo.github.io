    <p>You might want to try the Dell XPS 13. Dell is releasing a lightweight 13 inch XPS 13 laptop loaded with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. It’s targeted for mostly developers, but is sold to anyone that’s interested. Here are some highlights from the <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9234126/Dell_ships_lightweight_XPS_13_laptop_with_Ubuntu_Linux?source=rss_operatingsystems">article</a> published by Computerworld.</p>

<p>For developers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over six months, Dell worked with the open-source community to develop tools, drivers and software for the OS to work on XPS 13.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s a little bit pricey.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The laptop has an Intel Core i7 CPU, 8GB RAM and 256GB of storage. Priced at $1,549, it comes with one year of on-site support as part of the package. The laptop is now available in the U.S. and Canada, and will become available in other countries next year.</p>

  <p>The company has described the new XPS 13 with Ubuntu as a developer edition, but will sell the product to enterprises and consumers as well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Some really great features here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The joint development effort has also led to some new features unique to the laptop. One is called the “profile tool,” which enables developers to easily set up software development environments via quick access to tools for Ruby, JavaScript and Android in the github repositories.</p>

  <p>Another feature on XPS 13 is the “Cloud Launcher” which Dell said allows for simulation of cloud environments on the laptop. The simulated environment can then be deployed directly to the cloud.</p>
