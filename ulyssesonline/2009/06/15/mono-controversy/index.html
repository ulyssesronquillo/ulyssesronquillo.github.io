    <p>There is a raging debate at the moment in the Linux community whether Mono applications should be removed from Linux distributions. Supporters from both sides of the camp have been quick to point out the merits and the dangers of leaving Mono in Linux distributions.</p>

<p>What exactly is Mono? Mono is the open source development platform based on the Microsoft .NET framework. It allows developers to build Linux and cross-platform applications with improved developer productivity. Mono can run on Linux, BSD, UNIX, Mac OS X, Solaris and Windows operating systems.</p>

<p>The Mono project is led by Novell. The project was formerly owned by Ximian. To some Linux users, a simple mention of Novell sends chills down their spine mainly because they thought Novell slept with the enemy. Novell and Microsoft reached an agreement in 2006 to collaborate on technologies, mainly Novell’s eDirectory and Microsoft’s Active Directory.</p>

<p>But there is another part of the agreement that made Linux users more upset. Novell has signed an agreement with Microsoft that guarantees them safety if legal action is taken by Microsoft for patent infringements against Linux. Despite the threat, Microsoft still hasn’t given any details as to which Linux code violates its patents.</p>

<p>The hatred for Mono runs deep in the Linux community mainly because Mono is a platform that spreads its seed. Mono, by nature, create programs that run in Linux. In fact, Mono footprints are all over Gnome and Linux. Tomboy Notes, F-Spot Manager and Banshee are just a few applications that are developed in Mono.</p>

<p>To Linux purists, Mono applications should be stripped from all of Linux. There are other open-source alternatives that can take its place. If Mono is allowed to roam freely in Linux, the potential for legal action is ever present. It just a matter of time whether Microsoft exercises it or not.</p>

<p>Are the Mono concerns well-founded?</p>
