<meta name="description" content="If you are curious in how much radiation your wireless phone emits, check out the EWG or Environmental Working Group website. They give out a list of smart phones and PDAs based on radiation emitted. The phone with the least radiation is the Samsung Impression (SGH-a877) tested at 0.15 – 0.35 W/kg. The worst offending phones are the Motorola MOTO VU204 and Kyocera Jax S1300, both tested at 1.55 W/kg. Several dozens phones do not yet have any data. If you’re looking for a brand new phone, this is a good site to check, especially if you are one of those people who love to pin the phone to their ears. The best advice still, is to get one of those comfortable headsets, because even bluetooth devices emit radiation as well." />
