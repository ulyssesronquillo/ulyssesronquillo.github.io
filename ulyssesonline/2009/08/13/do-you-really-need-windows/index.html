    <p>Do you really need to run Windows? It’s a question most computer users haven’t really thought about. Most users perform basic functions such as browsing the web, checking email, word processing or running a basic spreadsheet. What most people don’t realize is that these are functions that you can easily perform and run in Linux.</p>

<p>Most users are already familiar with the Firefox browser. If you’re not a Firefox fan, you can use Google Chrome which also available in Linux. If you’re still not happy with either one, you can try Opera, Konqueror, Flock, Galeon, Epiphany and even Lynx, a text-based browser.</p>

<p>There are a number of options in Linux for word processing. Open Office is pretty much standard in most Linux distributions. You can also use KOffice or AbiWord. The same goes for spreadsheets. The choices are many.</p>

<p>One benefit Window users will get from Linux is having a rock stable environment that’s free from viruses. In addition, Linux will cost you $0 dollars. It’s absolutely free. Compare that when buying <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/2009/07/10/windows-7-pricing/">Windows 7</a> upgrade or the full version.</p>

<p>When I converted to Linux, there was a transition period where I was running both Windows and Linux on my desktop. I dual booted for several months before moving strictly to Linux. Weaning Windows users might be the ideal approach for the switch.</p>

<p>Linux has come a long way. Linux is grown up. Linux has improve by leaps and bounds. If you’re still on the fence about converting to Linux, well, get off it. Give Linux a try. It’s definitely worth your while.</p>
