    <p>Ubuntu 9.10 aka Karmic Koala is scheduled for release October 29, 2009. Ubuntu 9.10 is currently in Beta. There will be one more release called “Release Candidate” before the October 29 release announcement. Well, why wait when you can upgrade now. Most of the grunt work for Ubuntu 9.10 has already been done. The new features are already set. The Ubuntu Development team are busy working on fixing bugs now. I’m sure there will be updates before the October 29 release. And there will be more updates thereafter. It’s just the fact of life, the nature of Linux distributions. So, why wait when you can have it now. If you’re itching to see the latest Ubuntu 9.04 features, you can upgrade now. Here’s what you need to do to upgrade to Ubuntu 9.04.</p>

<h3 id="for-desktop-systems">For Desktop Systems</h3>

<p>To upgrade from Ubuntu 9.04 on a desktop system, press <strong>Alt+F2</strong> and type in “<strong>update-manager -d</strong>” (without the quotes) into the command box. Update Manager should open up and tell you: New distribution release ‘9.10’ is available. <strong>Click Upgrade</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>

<h3 id="for-ubuntu-server">For Ubuntu Server</h3>

<p>To upgrade from Ubuntu 9.04 on a server system: install the <strong><tt>update-manager-core</tt></strong> package if it is not already installed; edit <strong><tt>/etc/update-manager/release-upgrades</tt></strong> and set <strong><tt>Prompt=normal</tt></strong>; launch the upgrade tool with the command <strong><tt>sudoÂ do-release-upgradeÂ -d</tt></strong>; and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>

<p>One more thing: we are 12 days away from the final product. It’s as good as it gets, but backup your data and expect a few bugs.</p>
