    <p>Posting via email is one of few features used sparingly by WordPress users. Most bloggers use the Admin – Dashboard interface to publish a post. Posting via email is a feature that has been around as long as I can remember, perhaps going back as far back as version 1.5. I’ve posted on via email once before and I don’t remember any details. To this day, I don’t know why I don’t use it. I thought I give this feature another try. Why not. The advantage of posting via email is you can work on an offline article with an email client. Another advantage is sending posts from a phone.</p>

<p>Ok, success. I was able to send a post via email. You are reading this article as proof. Just a couple of interesting things I want to add to the original post. You need to run wp-mail.php each time you send a post. That’s each time! Well, that sucks. I was hoping this whole process would be automated. You can however, install a plugin called WP-Cron, similar to the Unix command called cron, that will run wp-mail.php every 15 minutes or so. Better yet, if you have access to your server, just add a cron job to run wp-mail.php every 15 minutes.</p>

<p>If you need help in setting up your WordPress to send posts via email, you can read the documentation and installation setup <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_to_your_blog_using_email">here</a>.</p>
