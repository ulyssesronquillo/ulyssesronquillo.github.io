    <p>I’ve just gathered a few articles worth noting as Windows 7 begins to take shape. As most of you know, Windows 7 Release Candidate <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9132389&amp;">was released to the general public</a> for download. It’s a bit odd for Microsoft to do this. Was Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/the_windows_7_give_away">feeling the pressure to release it</a>? I just can’t get over the fact that Microsoft is giving away their latest OS for free with a license that will not expire until June 1, 2010. Perhaps, it was to relieve the pressure from Vista users for all their troubles.</p>

<p>Microsoft plans to offer <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9127259&amp;source=landingpage">six different versions of Windows 7</a>. That seems a lot. Confusion may abound. There is a Starter edition which runs in <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=operating_systems&amp;articleId=9132557&amp;taxonomyId=89&amp;intsrc=kc_top">XP mode</a> targeting netbooks. XP mode <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=4241&amp;tag=rbxccnbzd1">is a bit restrictive</a> since it can <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124018108488732939.html">only run three applications at one time</a>. Also, initial results of the speed test indicate that <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=operating_systems&amp;articleId=9132665&amp;taxonomyId=89&amp;intsrc=kc_top">Windows 7 is not much faster than Vista</a>. In addition, Microsoft also released the Windows 7 <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=2643">system requirements</a> and they are not much different than Vista.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyName=operating_systems&amp;articleId=9132626&amp;taxonomyId=89&amp;intsrc=kc_top">Complaints</a> are beginning to trickle in. <a href="http://mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> recently said Windows 7 <a href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2009-05-07-015-35-OS-MS-LL">poses an unfair advantage</a> over other browsers. That sounds familiar? There are <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9132522">other issues</a> as well. One reviewer said Windows 7 did not install because it <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/installing_windows_7_with_some_linux_help">could not recognize the hard drive</a>. The user had to use Gparted, a Linux tool to partition a drive and then Windows 7 proceeded with the install. Classic.</p>

<p>Do we expect big changes between now and the final release? Maybe. Maybe not. Report show that Microsoft tends to be <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/24/open_source_windows/">slow in their development</a>. There are not too many changes between the beta version and the release candidate. The downer is that initial reports indicate that as much as <a href="http://www.daniweb.com/blogs/entry4236.html#">84% of businesses will not upgrade</a> to Windows 7.</p>

<p>In any case, we all want the Windows 7 product to succeed. We don’t want all Windows users switching to other operating systems like Linux and the Mac, do we?</p>
