<h3 id="windows-7-prices">Windows 7 Prices</h3>

<p><strong>Preorder</strong> – Starting June 26 until July 11, 2009, Windows users can preorder Windows 7 Home Edition and Professional. This is a limited time offer. This is an upgrade version and NOT the full version. Upgrades are available for Windows XP and Vista users only.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Preorder Windows 7 Home Premium Edition  <strong>$50</strong></li>
  <li>PreOrder Windows 7 Professional  <strong>$100</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Family Pack</strong> – Allows 3 PCs in a single household to be upgraded to Windows 7 Home Edition. This is an upgrade only. Details on this offer is <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9135325/Resellers_reveal_Windows_7_Family_Pack_price?taxonomyId=125">sketchy</a>. Wait for Microsoft’s official announcement.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Family Pack Windows 7 Home Premium Edition  <strong>$150</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Upgrades</strong> – Upgrades are available only for Windows XP and Vista users only. Earlier versions are not supported.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade  <strong>$120</strong></li>
  <li>Windows 7 Professional Upgrade <strong>$200</strong></li>
  <li>Windows 7 Ultimate Upgrade <strong>$220</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Full Version</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 7 Home Premium Full Version <strong>$200</strong></li>
  <li>Windows 7 Professional Full Version <strong>$300</strong></li>
  <li>Windows 7 Ultimate Full Version <strong>$320</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Buying a PC now</strong> – Starting June 26 to October 22 and beyond, buyers of PCs with Windows XP and Vista installed can upgrade to Windows 7 for <strong>FREE</strong>. This is a bit deceiving because the actual cost is outlined below in the <strong>OEM</strong> which is passed on eventually to consumers.</p>

<p><strong>OEM Price</strong> – Cost after October 22 when you buy a brand new system with a Windows 7 operating system. The cost is passed on to the consumers by vendors. Currently, the OEM cost are: Windows XP $15, Vista Home Basic $97, Vista Home Premium $121, Vista Business $153 and Vista Ultimate for $205. See the OEM prices for <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/taking_a_beating_with_windows_7_pricing">XP</a> and <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=187">Vista</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 7 Starter Edition OEM  <strong>$50</strong> (1)</li>
  <li>Windows 7 Home Premium OEM  <strong>$200</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This means, if you buy a $700 PC, you paid for $500 for hardware and $200 to Microsoft for the operating system.</p>

<p>(1) Please note that Microsoft has placed a limit on the hardware requirements for the Starter Edition. Vendors have to comply not to install Windows 7 Starter Edition on anything less than the following: 10.2 inch screen, 1GB RAM, 250GB hard drive, 64GB solid state, and on a single core processor with less than 2GHz.</p>

<p><strong>Europe</strong> – If you live in Europe, you poor souls, expect to pay a lot more, almost double for what the US users will be paying. After all, Microsoft has to pay all those programmers to strip IE from Windows 7 and also pay for the new packaging of Windows 7E. By the way, there is no upgrade, just the full version.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Windows 7 Home Premium Full Version  <strong>$120</strong></li>
  <li>Windows 7 Professional Full Version <strong>$286</strong></li>
  <li>Windows 7 Ultimate Full Version  <strong>$300</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Competition</strong> – Finally, let’s compare the rest of the competition:</p>

<p><strong>Mac OS X</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Mac OS X Leopard Upgrade <strong>$29</strong></li>
  <li>Mac OS X Leopard <strong>$129</strong></li>
  <li>Mac OS X Leopard Family Pack <strong>$199</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Linux</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Linux Upgrade $0.00</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Linux Full Version $0.00</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Linux All Universe Pack $0.00</strong></li>
</ul>
