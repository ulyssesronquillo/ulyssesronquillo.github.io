    <p>The 2010 release of Google Chrome OS seems light years away, but it generated a few lively discussions on its implications of the OS wars to follow. Will Google’s Chrome OS command a market share? Or does it merely push Microsoft and Apple to move into a more web-centric approach bound to its cloud services. The <a href="http://techczar.wordpress.com/2009/07/15/google-chrome-os-a-game-of-chess/">Tech Czar</a> blog seem to think of the latter.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key to the Chrome strategy is that Google does not expect to get a large chunk of market share, what they want is to put pressure on Microsoft and Apple to add features similar to what Chrome OS has, which by nature will be very Web-centric.Â This minimalist desktop approach that is tightly bound to cloud services is the core of Chrome OS, Microsoft and Apple will be forced to make adjustments that will be in Googles favor, just to compete.</p>

  <p>Google is really in a win-win situation, as it was with their Chrome browser, that has a minimal amount of market share but was the initiator of more browser wars focused on Javascript speed and more stable browsing; both of which are central to Googleâ€™s cloud services taking off.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If that’s the case, Linux can stand pat and benefit from Google Chrome OS by virtually doing nothing. The focus seems will be on Google Chrome OS and not on Linux. This scenario doesn’t really bother Linux users like myself.</p>

<p>I don’t see current Linux users dropping their distribution and switching allegiance to Google Chrome OS. I’m sure, I’ll try it for curiosity’s sake. In the end, Linux users will be more supported with more and better drivers, and finally, perhaps more software written for the Linux OS. That’s a win for Linux.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to speculate as to what tack Google will take in the next 15 months.</p>
