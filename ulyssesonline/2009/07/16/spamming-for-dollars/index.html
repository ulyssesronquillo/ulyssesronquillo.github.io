    <p>The main reason spam is around is because of money. Spammers can potentially rake in millions of dollars. The Storm botnet rakes in an estimated $3.5 million dollars annually. Seems like easy money? Well, not quite. The conversion rate for spam is miniscule; spammers have to send out in bulk to get results. UCSD and International Computer Science Institute shared their <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3830011/Spam%20Not%20So%20Profitable.htm">findings</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Research reported 569 conversions on close to 500 million spam messages. They sent three different kinds of messages, two of which were similar to the spam the botnet uses to propagate. A third message contained faux pharmaceutical spam similar to how the botnet makes money. The researchers sent 347,590,389 pharmaceutical spam messages which generated 10,522 site visits and 28 sales — conversion rate of 0.0000081 percent.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sounds inefficient to me, but if you consider that 85-90% of the worldwide email is spam, then you finally get to see the whole picture. Of course, spam spawns other effects in the IT infrastructure such as increase storage, the cost of anti-virus software and the hiring of security staff. Come to think of it, the IT cost attributable to spam alone is massive.</p>
