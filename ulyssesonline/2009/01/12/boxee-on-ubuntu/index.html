    <p>I finally got a chance to play around with<a href="http://boxee.tv"> Boxee</a> on my desktop which is running on Ubuntu Hardy 8.04. Boxee is an entertainment aggregator which can play Netflix, Hulu, CBS, Comedy Central, Last.fm, and flickr. In addition, it can also play local movies, music and photos.</p>

<p><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/boxee-activity-e1290802150320.png" alt="" title="boxee-activity" /></p>

<p>The interface is slick and intuitive. It’s based on an easy to use menu system that can be learned easily. I was able to watch Netflix, Prison Break and a couple of other movies in a drop of a hat. It takes a little getting use to for someone to get a feel how the software works, but after a couple of minutes, you can get a couple of TV shows playing on your computer.</p>

<p>There are a lot of content out there, but my only beef is that the list of shows is not comprehensive enough. But, that’s not the fault of Boxee which merely works as an entertainment aggregator. Boxee runs on the Apple’s Mac, Apple TV and Linux machines. Surprisingly, it doesn’t run on Windows, but it will soon.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://tech.yahoo.com/news/pcworld/20090109/tc_pcworld/boxeeopensourceconnectedtv">Yahoo article</a> lead me to Boxee. Here’s some details of the article worth mentioning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Boxee will play the music and movies you have on your own hard drive. But it will also play content from services like <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_4">Netflix</span>, <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_5">Hulu</span>, <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_6">YouTube</span>, Shoutcast, <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/pcworld/tc_pcworld/storytext/boxeeopensourceconnectedtv/30506054/SIG=10gkr3d0q/*http://Last.fm"><span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_7">Last.fm</span></a>, <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_8">Flickr</span>, <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_9">Picasa</span>, CNN and lots more. Itâ€™ll pull in <span class="yshortcuts" id="lw_1231621761_10">video podcasts</span> and if you want a podcast Boxee doesnâ€™t offer, you simply add the URL of the feed.</p>

  <p>You access all this content through an attractive and fairly intuitive interface designed for being navigated with a remote from the couch.</p>

  <p>The last part of the package could turn out to be the most powerful. You can share what youâ€™re watching with other Boxee users and they can share their viewing habits â€“ and recommendations â€“ with you. As more and more video and music becomes freely available on the Web, those kinds of recommendations from people you trust could become a great way to find the best of the avalanche of content.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Give Boxee a try. If you are a Windows user, you may have to wait a few more weeks unless you try and install Ubuntu for free now.</p>
