    <p>Have you ever wondered how others have added special effects to their webcams? Special effects like distorted faces, fire, mosaic and colors. Other effects include wearing hats, costumes and glasses. Changing hairstyles or add facial hair is also possible. If you are looking for a software program that adds a variety of these effects I’ve mentioned above, then take a look at <a href="http://www.webcammax.com/">WebcamMax</a>.</p>

<p>What is WebcamMax? WebcamMax is a software program that runs on Windows 2000, XP or Windows Vista. The program allows you to use thousands of special effects on your existing webcam. WebcamMax works with many popular chat programs such as MSN, Yahoo Messenger, CamFrog, ICQ, Aim, Skype, Paltalk, ANYwebcam, Stickam and many others. The software also acts as a recorder for capturing videos that you can later share with friends in YouTube or on your blog.</p>

<p>In addition, WebcamMax allows you to share your computer screen with family or friends. You can also share any photo or a movie clip. Another excellent feature of WebcamMax is the ability to broadcast or display two sources at the same time. This feature is called Picture in Picture or PinP.

Buying a license will remove the watermark and the 30 day time limitation. It also offers free future updates. License cost vary. You can select 6 months for $19.95, 1 year for $29.95, 2 years at $39.95 or a lifetime (enjoy forever) license for $49.95.</p>

<p>Live Streaming</p>

<p>In addition, WebcamMax also works with live streaming. I’ve tested it at <a href="http://ustream.tv">ustream.tv</a>. My setup uses a Canon ZR-950 camcorder connected via Firewire to my Lenovo S10 laptop. With the WebcamMax software, I can switch sources selecting either my Canon camcorder, the laptop’s built-in webcam, a video or a movie clip, a photo and even my laptop’s screen. Sharing any of two sources I’ve mentioned is possible using the Picture in Picture (PinP) feature.</p>
