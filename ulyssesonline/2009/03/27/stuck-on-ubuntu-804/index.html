    <p>I have to admit, I am stuck on Ubuntu 8.04. I have been an Ubuntu user since version 5.04 Hoary Hedgehog. Every six months, I have religiously upgraded to every version of Ubuntu that came along from version 5.04 Hoary Hedgehog, Breezy Badger, Edgy Eft, Feisty Fawn to version 8.04 Hardy Heron. And that is where it stops. I tried Ubuntu version 8.10 Intrepid Ibex, but there were a couple things that broke. I ended up putting back 8.04 Hardy Heron because everything seems to work fine with Hardy Heron. They don’t call it Hardy for no reason.</p>

<p>The biggest killer for me was screen rotation support. I have this HP w2207h widescreen monitor with swivel functionality and I need to have an Ubuntu version capable of rotating my screen by 90 degrees to support portrait viewing. Oh yes, Intrepid supports it, but not quite the way I wanted it. I need to be able to rotate it from the menu screen and not from the command-line or some third-party software.</p>

<p>So fast forward to today, I just heard that <a href="http://www.clububuntu.com/2009/03/ubuntu-904-jaunty-jackalope-beta.html">Jaunty Jackalope Beta</a> was just released. Some of the new features being touted are: ext4 support, new login screen, some new wallpapers, faster boot-time and updated versions of software. Hmmm. For some reason, I am not so impressed. But still, I should upgrade. Well, not quite so fast. Why fix something that’s not broken. So, I’m stuck on Ubuntu 8.04 for the time being.</p>

<p>It’s a good thing <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/2008/12/02/reason-to-stay-with-ubuntu-804/">Ubuntu Hardy Heron is under LTS support</a> or Long Term Support. I don’t have to worry until April 2011 for support to end. Wow, that’s two more years from today. I will milk it for all its worth. You can almost guess what my next article will be, “I’m stuck on Windows XP.” I love Windows XP compared to Vista, but I digress. Well, that’s another story. In the meantime, the Ubuntu Update Manager is calling me to update my system. Well, you have to excuse me while my system is updating. And yes, there are no reboots required.</p>
