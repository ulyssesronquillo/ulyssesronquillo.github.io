As of today, LastPass is now available free on all your devices. You can now do all the things that you could do on your desktop on all your devices for free! And that includes the ability to save and fill out passwords, a password generator, secure notes, and two-factor authentication. Well, it’s a good thing I resisted to pay extra for my devices. Seriously, if you like to go Premium, it’s only $12 per year. LastPass has to make money somehow. So even with that, it’s not like you’re going to break the bank. It’s an excellent program after all." />
