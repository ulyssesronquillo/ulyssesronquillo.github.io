<meta name="description" content="Six months ago, I installed a SSD drive on my Mac Mini. The speed of the SSD drive was a welcome addition. System boot up was cut in half. Access to applications were almost instant. It was all fun until I started having problems with SSD drive. Constant hangs and constant reboots for several weeks took its toll. Thanks to Time Machine, I’m now restoring my entire drive back to my original hard drive which is not in use. The restore process should take a couple of hours or so. I expect my computer to be slower with the hard drive, but it should be more stable than my current SSD." />
