<meta name="description" content="My phone contract is coming up this month. It’s time to think about the next phone. There are many choices to consider. There is Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus along with its Apple Pay. Then there’s the new Google’s Nexus 6 and the slightly older Nexus 5 model from last year. One thing I am seriously considering is lowering my monthly payments to affordable levels. I’m targeting perhaps around $50 for monthly payments. The only way I can achieve this is to purchase an unlocked phone to go along with T-Mobile’s prepaid plans. So, the iPhone 6 is definitely out of the question. The Nexus 6 is very tempting, but the price tag of $650 is both disappointing and discouraging. So, that leaves me with last year’s Nexus 5. An unlocked Nexus sells for $399. This might be my next phone. I’m still looking around for other options. If you have any suggestions, please let me know." />
