    <p>When the PS3 first came out, a few people were buying it because it was a cheaper alternative to buying a BluRay player. But, those days are over. The price of BluRay players have come down considerably. Others were buying the PS3 because they could run an alternative OS like Linux.</p>

<p>Starting April 1, the latest firmware update from Sony will disable the PS3 from booting an alternative OS. The PS3 will no longer support Linux. A bummer. It’s a sad day for Linux and even sadder day for Sony. Does Sony really think people will buy the PS3 solely because they just want the PS3?</p>

<p>If you start removing the reasons why people should buy your product, then you are taking away potential revenue. It’s not like the PS3 has a monopoly in this industry. It has plenty of competition from the Xbox and Wii.</p>

<p>The official reason why Sony did it. Security concerns.</p>

<p>But, that’s not the least of their <a href="http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Playstation-3-Update-locks-out-Linux-and-Ubuntu-bricks-consoles">problems</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consumers are reporting that the update has led to a variety of bugs, including slowed internet connections, controller compatibility issues, and resolution issues when using HDMI. And that’s if the update installs at all, as there have been reports that the download cycle hits an endless loop and never fully completes.</p>

  <p>Opting to not download the update bars the user from accessing the Playstation Store, playing games online or playing any games or Blu-ray movies that require the 3.21 update to function.</p>

  <p>Only a sliver of the open-source community used the PS3 to run Linux or Ubuntu, but Sony’s decision to cut them out is still a disappointing one, especially considering that it affects users who didn’t even install another OS.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, sometimes fixing an one issue leads to a whole slew of other issues. You open up Pandora’s box. Users end up with some brick consoles that could only be fixed via RMA.</p>
