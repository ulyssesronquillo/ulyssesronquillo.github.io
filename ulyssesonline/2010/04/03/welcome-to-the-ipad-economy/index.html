    <p>The iPad comes out today. It will be available at the Apple Store. People who ordered the iPad in advance should be getting it this weekend or perhaps earlier next week. So, what’s an iPad. An iPad is basically an iPod, but 4 to 5 times bigger. The screen size is 9.7 inches and it’s a touchscreen. The cheapest iPad costs about $500 to $830 depending on the model.</p>

<p>It’s revolutionary. Hardly. There are other products that are similar, but it’s all about the applications. There are thousands of them. No one comes close. Thanks to the iPhone. One thing is for sure, the iPad has all the bells and whistles of an Apple product. And it’s customarily expensive.</p>

<p>I really don’t think Apple needs to market the product that hard because, the Apple drones are emptying their wallets once again. The techies will follow and the rest of us, ordinary folks on a limited budget, wish we could afford one. Don’t get me wrong. I love to have one, but no thanks. I’ll stick with my netbook for now.</p>

<p>So, we now have the iPod and iPad. What’s next? Surely, the iPeed and iPood. 🙂</p>
