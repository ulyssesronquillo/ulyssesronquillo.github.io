    <p>The NBA just banned its first ever pair of shoes in its 64 year history. The NBA commissioner, David Stern said, the shoes will give players an unfair advantage . The shoes allegedly will give players an added vertical boost. As if they really need more air time. They are all tall.</p>

<p>The banned shoes are made by a company called Athletic Propulsion Labs. They are called Concept 1. See a picture of the banned shoe below. For mere mortals like you and me, you might want to go to the bank first before heading out to the store, because the shoes will cost you $300.</p>

<p><a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/nbashoes-e1290719362346.jpg"><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/nbashoes-e1290719362346.jpg" alt="" title="nbashoes" /></a></p>

<p>In my opinion, the shoes are not going to make you any taller, dribble or shoot any better. It might give you, one inch or two, of added vertical jump, but what good is it, if you’re 5’8 and under.</p>

<p>If everyone in the NBA wears the Concept 1, the added vertical leap will be all a wash. No gain nor loss. Maybe, quite a few more thunderous dunks. By banning the shoes, the commissioner’s message is quite clear. He is protecting business, protecting Nike, Adidas and others. I’m not surprise. It’s a business after all.</p>
