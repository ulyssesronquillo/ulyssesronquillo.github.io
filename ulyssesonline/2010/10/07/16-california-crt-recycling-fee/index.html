The difference is that I bought the monitor online and I didn’t get slapped by $16 recycling fee because it was an out of state purchase." />

    <p>I recently paid a $16 California CRT Recycling Fee for a new purchase of a 20 inch monitor. What! Are you kidding me? I just bought a new monitor. Now, the state of California want $16 of my hard-earned dollars for a disposal fee — of my brand new monitor. Ridiculous! Apparently, the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/112649/california_imposes_crt_recycling_fee.html">law</a> has been in effect since July 1, 2004. I think I may have purchased another monitor before 2004. I vaguely recall. The difference is that I bought the monitor online and I didn’t get slapped by $16 recycling fee because it was an out of state purchase.</p>

<p>I know $16 is peanuts, but $16 here and there adds up after a while.</p>

<p>And you wonder why the state has a shortfall of income. I’m not even going to bring up overspending. The monitor recycling fee is just another example of California encouraging consumers to buy out of state or online as opposed to buying within the state and supporting local businesses. In tough economic times, consumers will find ways to cut back in spending and that includes avoiding taxes and fees if they can get away with it.</p>

<p>With this law, the State of California imposes taxes on monitors sold within the state. If you’ve purchased out of state, California has no way of enforcing such laws. So they tax you up front and I supposed they will also tax you after as well. The EPA can also issue fines if you improperly discard your old monitors. With th $16 fee, you should be able to discard old computers and monitors through your garbage disposal company, but that’s not the case.</p>

<p>You still have to call a recycling company or setup a special pickup from a charitable company. I just want to know how my $16 dollar fee is being spent by the state. Is that too much to ask?</p>
