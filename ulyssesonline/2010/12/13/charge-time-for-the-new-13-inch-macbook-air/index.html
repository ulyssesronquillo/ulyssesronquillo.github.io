    <p>How long does it take to charge the new 2010 13 inch MacBook Air? I’m curious more than anything, So I ran a couple of tests. I charged my new MacBook Air the other day, when the system was completely bone dry, until the unit was 100% fully charge.</p>

<p>My results: It takes about 1 hour and 30 minutes, on average, to charge my 13 inch MacBook Air. I have no idea how long does it take for the 11 inch model, since I don’t own one, but I’m curious if the results are any close.</p>

<p>Based on what I’m <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=441139">reading here</a> on the Mac Forums, the older MacBook Airs had on average, a charge time of about 4 to 5 hours. Some longer than others. One poster said it took him 8 hours. That’s a bit too much.</p>

<p>So, based on that information, it looks like the charge time for the new 2010 MacBook Air, is at least 3 times faster than its predecessor. Quite an impressive feat.</p>

<p>Often, users only ask about battery life, but they forget to ask about the battery’s charge time. With the new MacBook Air’s charge time of about a third of a time, it’s one spec Apple forgot to mention.</p>

<p>Next on the agenda, battery life. Apple says it’s between 5-7 hours. I want to test.</p>

<p>Stay tuned.</p>
