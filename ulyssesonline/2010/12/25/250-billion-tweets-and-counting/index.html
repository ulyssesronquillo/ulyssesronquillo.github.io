    <p>Twitter had 250 billion tweets in 2010. It also added 100 million new users. An amazing growth for a company that’s only been around for a few years. Twitter has also improved its infrastructure exponentially, being able to support growth while minimizing downtimes. I haven’t seen or heard the fail whale for quite some time. That’s a good thing. The last I heard was during the World Cup this past summer. I might have missed one or two along the way.</p>

<p>So, what’s new this year? Twitter’s development team continued to innovate and add value to the Twitter’s experience, by cranking out new features, such as a new homepage, embedded media, tlists, and so on. And what do I expect next year? Twitter will probably double its record number of tweets. Maybe add a few more hundred million users. How about a trillion tweets. Why not.</p>

<p>Finally, there’s a nice story in the San Francisco Chronicle about the artist who drew the infamous <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/12/25/BUJC1GTA73.DTL">fail whale</a>.</p>
