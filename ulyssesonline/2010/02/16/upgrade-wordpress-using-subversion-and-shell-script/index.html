    <p>Every couple of months or so, a new version of WordPress comes out. If you own a dozen blogs in your arsenal, you will need to upgrade each one of them. Thankfully, there is the automatic upgrade button available within WordPress. But still, you still have to login to each one of them and click on each button to upgrade WordPress. You wish there was an easy way to upgrade all 20 blogs with a single command.</p>

<p>Well, there is a simple solution with the help of Subversion and Shell Script. For several years, I have been using Subversion to upgrade WordPress. Each time there is a new version of WordPress, I just type in a single command to upgrade a dozen blogs or so. For the most part, it takes less than 30 seconds to upgrade a dozen of blogs.</p>

<p>Here is the simple Shell Script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pre lang="bash"&gt;
#!/bin/sh
# A script to upgrade dozens of WordPress installs using Subversion.

wpv=http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.9.2

echo “Upgrading blog 1”
cd /home/user/blog1.com/
svn switch $wpv

echo “Upgrading blog2.com”
cd /home/user/blog2.com/
svn switch $wpv

echo “Upgrading blog3.com”
cd /home/user/blog3.com/
svn switch $wpv
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and so on….</p>

<p>If you have 20 blogs or so, you will need to include all 20 of them in one little script. You just need to change the “wpv” variable to point to the latest WordPress version. Once you made the change, and depending on the amount of files that has changed from one version to the next, the upgrade process can take anywhere from 10-30 seconds — that’s for 20 blogs!</p>

<p>For this script to work, you will need access to a web server that supports both Subversion and SSH. First, you need to install WordPress using Subversion. That can be easily done using the Subversion Checkout command. Once installed, you can create a simple Shell script like the one above, to execute the upgrade process. If your web host supports both, you might want to consider this little script when upgrading WordPress.</p>
