    <p>I was scratching my head as to why my bbPress forum was displaying topics with negative numbers. It seems to coincide every time someone deletes a topic. The number of topics can sometimes falls below zero into negative territory. It just looks odd to have a forum with negative topics.</p>

<p>In any case, the fix is to login as Admin and perform a Recount. Just go to Manage &gt; Recount. I checked on the first 7 boxes. I skipped boxes 8 and 9 that either delete or remove posts with no topics, etc. It only takes a few seconds to perform the recount. Once recounted, the topics would show the correct values.</p>

<p>I never did get a clear explanation as to what is causing the negative numbers to show up. There seems to be a <a href="http://bbpress.org/forums/topic/errors-in-bbpress-seen-on-the-official-forums">good discussion</a> at the bbPress forum, but it seems the question was never resolved.</p>
