    <p><a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/12/facebook_november_15_announcement/">Rumor</a> has it that Facebook is set to unleashed its own email service next Monday. It’s certainly no surprise since Facebook already has that capability with its own private messages between friends. With this new mail service, Facebook will be able to send out messages not just to other Facebook members, but to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>So, what’s the big deal? That’s exactly what I said. But there’s a catch. Facebook apparently has been working with Microsoft in integrating Microsoft Office Online Tools. Facebook users will be able to share Office documents with other Facebook users and possibly with everyone else.</p>

<p>One more thing, with this new email service, Facebook users will be able to use the ‘facebook.com’ domain as part of their email address. The email address format will most likely be: username@facebook.com. That’s one thing you’ll have in common with a Facebook employee, having the same email domain.</p>

<p>Is this a threat to GMail? I don’t see it that way. GMail has enough features that will stave off users from jumping to Facebook. In addition, Facebook has a marginal record when it comes to security and privacy. Will I trust them enough to run my email. That’s one concern that will be on everyone’s mind.</p>
