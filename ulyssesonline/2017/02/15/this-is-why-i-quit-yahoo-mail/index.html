    <p>This is why I quit using Yahoo Mail six months ago! How many times is enough? This time it’s forged cookies! Thankfully, I didn’t get that additional notification from Yahoo that my account was targeted. Whew! A close call, but you can never be sure. Anyways, here’s the message I received this morning.</p>

<p>“Dear Ulysses,</p>

<p>We are writing to inform you about a data security issue that involves your Yahoo account. We have taken steps to secure your account and are working closely with law enforcement.</p>

<p>Our outside forensic experts have been investigating the creation of forged cookies that could allow an intruder to access users’ accounts without a password. Based on the ongoing investigation, we believe a forged cookie may have been used in 2015 or 2016 to access your account. We have connected some of the cookie forging activity to the same state-sponsored actor believed to be responsible for the data theft we disclosed on September 22, 2016. Those users targeted by the state-sponsored actor were sent an additional notification like the one found here: <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN26995.html">https://help.yahoo.com/kb/<wbr />&lt;/wbr&gt;SLN26995.html</a>.</p>

<p>We invalidated the forged cookies and hardened our systems to secure them against similar attacks. We continuously enhance our safeguards and systems that detect and prevent unauthorized access to user accounts.</p>

<p>We encourage you to follow these security recommendations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review all of your accounts for suspicious activity.</li>
  <li>Be cautious of any unsolicited communications that ask for your personal information or refer you to a web page asking for personal information.</li>
  <li>Avoid clicking on links or downloading attachments from suspicious emails.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, please consider using Yahoo Account Key, a simple authentication tool that eliminates the need to use a password on Yahoo altogether.</p>

<p><strong>For More Information</strong></p>

<p>For more information about this issue and our security resources, please visit the Yahoo Account Security Issue FAQs page available at <a href="https://yahoo.com/security-update">https://yahoo.com/security-<wbr />&lt;/wbr&gt;update</a>.</p>

<p>Protecting your information is important to us and we work continuously to strengthen our defenses.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Bob Lord<br />
Chief Information Security Officer<br />
Yahoo”</p>
