At least they’re trying to be nice by muting the audio if you scroll down past the video. Facebook is giving you the option to have the volume ON automatically, but why would you do that? If you don’t want videos playing in the background at all, you can turn it OFF by going to the Settings and setting Auto-Play Videos to Off. That’s what I would do." />
