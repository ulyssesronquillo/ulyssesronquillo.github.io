    <p>I’m currently working on a home project which replaces the carpet in the living room with wooden laminated floors. I have no prior experience in this type of work. I have seen others do it a couple of years ago when we contracted the work for the room upstairs. Of course, doing it firsthand is a completely a different experience.</p>

<p>After two days, so far so good. The hardest part of the work is actually not the laying out of the wooden laminated floors, but moving the furniture, ripping off the carpet and the cushioning, removing the baseboards, nails and cleaning up the floor. Once the prep work was completed, the layout of the floors went fairly quickly.</p>

<p>Actually, the layout in the beginning was a bit tricky since the boards shifted quite a bit. After the third and fourth row, the wooden boards stopped shifting and the layout went fairly quickly.</p>

<p>A couple of tips for anyone willing to do the floor work themselves. I recommend you watched a video clip from Armstrong on how to layout wooden laminated floors. I was able to pick up a few valuable tips.</p>

<p>Regarding cutting the laminated wood boards, I recommend you use a wet tile saw since the wet saw reduces the amount of saw sawdust in the air. The tilesaw cuts the wood quite nicely. The water pan on the bottom of the unit collects most of the sawdust and the water can be disposed much later.</p>

<p>Here’s a few <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/gallery/floor/">pics</a> of the work so far.</p>
