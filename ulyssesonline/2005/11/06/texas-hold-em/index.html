    <p>I came home last night from a get together with friends. There were plenty of food, a few beers and of course, we played the popular game of poker called Texas Hold Em. One trend I’m beginning to pick up is I really suck in this game. Four games and each time an early exit. I don’t plan to quit my job and become a full time poker player like those you’ve seen on TV. It’s just not going to happen.</p>

<p>What’s seems to be the problem? I’m either too aggressive or just unlucky. I would like to believe the latter because we all know a “hand” in any card game is completely random. Having a good hand involves a lot of luck. I think a good understanding of the odds and a good understanding of the opponent goes a long way.</p>

<p>I think I take too many chances in this game. I guess I get too excited when I get a good hand. It’s hard not to when there’s an ace staring you in the face. I don’t have a lot of patience, either. Given my history, I should probably just stick to Hearts or FreeCell. Hehe.</p>
