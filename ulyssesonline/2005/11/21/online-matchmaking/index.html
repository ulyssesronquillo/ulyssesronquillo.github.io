    <p>I got a chuckle reading an article about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20051118/wr_nm/onlinedating_lawsuits_dc">online daters suing matchmaking sites</a>. I must admit, being single “I’ve been there and done that.” A couple years ago, I setup a profile at <a href="http://personals.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Personals</a>, <a href="http://match.com">Match.com</a> and <a href="http://friendster.com">Friendster</a>. I no longer have accounts with Match.com and Friendster, while my Yahoo profile is turned off. Why?</p>

<p>Looking for love in the wrong places? I think so. I’ve met several couples who have met their future mates online. That’s great. I’m happy for them. But, I learned that online matchmaking was not for me. I mean I tried. I must admit, I met some interesting people, I mean really interesting ones.</p>

<p>So, what’s the lawsuit about?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Match.com, a unit of IAC/Interactive Corp., is accused in a federal lawsuit of goading members into renewing their subscriptions through bogus romantic e-mails sent out by company employees. In some instances, the suit contends, people on the Match payroll even went on sham dates with subscribers as a marketing ploy.</p>

  <p>In a separate suit, Yahoo Inc.’s personals service is accused of posting profiles of fictitious potential dating partners on its Web site to make it look as though many more singles subscribe to the service than actually do.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like that never crossed my mind. At least, now my suspicions are confirmed. So, I’m back to the old-fashioned way of meeting people. That means “doing it myself.” I also realized that I already have my own matchmaking service because everytime I meet friends, relatives, acquaintaces and ex-classmates, they always start out with a question, “You’re still single?” It’s usually followed by a pregnant pause, then the ultimate capper, “I like you to meet someone.”</p>

<p>The great thing about it is, it’s unsolicited and most of all, it’s free.</p>
