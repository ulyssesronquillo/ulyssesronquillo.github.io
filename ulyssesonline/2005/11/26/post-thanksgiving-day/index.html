    <p>I made a trip to San Francisco yesterday to see the annual International Auto Show in Moscone Center. This is the 48th year of the show in San Francisco. I took a <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/gallery/autoshow/">few pictures</a> yesterday and posted it online. For $8 measley dollars, you can look at thousands of new vehicles from every manufacturer you can think of, as well as take a look at a few exotic cars.</p>

<p>It was raining when I left the house in Union City. I wore this thick Adidas water-repellant jacket underneath my sweater. It was a bad choice. By the time I stepped off the <a href="http://bart.gov">BART</a> train in San Francisco, the rain had stopped and the sun was out. Now, I was too hot. I was forced to lug around the jacket all day long. I guess better warm than cold especially in San Francisco.</p>

<p>I’m not really a car enthusiast, so I didn’t spend time on every one of them. In fact, I just breezed through many of them. The cars, trucks, SUVs and vans seemed to look the same after the while. I did pay special attention to a few cars that I like, but could not afford such as the Porsches, Ferraris, Lamborghinis and the Masaratis.</p>

<p>Thw BMW corner was nice, but way too many people were around the cars. I did enjoy sitting inside the Hummer. I checked out the 2006 Mustang. I still own a 1986 Mustang 5.0 GT sitting in the garage, so I have a special interest with Mustangs. I looked at a few Jeeps. I even entered a couple of drawings to win a car.</p>

<p>Just before heading home, I stopped by the <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> store in San Francisco to check out the Nano and the new iPod. I wanted to see how the new video looks like in the new slightly bigger iPod screen. I have to admit, it’s a very dangerous store for me to be in, since I love Apple products. I almost brought a “orphaned” Nano home with me.</p>

<p>Speaking of Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year. I made every effort to avoid shopping yesterday due to the crowds. You couldn’t help but feel the buzz everywhere you go in the city. The old Navy in San Francisco was packed and the Apple Store had twice as many people in them.</p>

<p>I always wondered why they called it Black Friday. It’s not because of the “plague,” but it’s because the day after Thanksgiving is the day retailers go into the “black.” I thought that was pretty neat.</p>
