    <p>I just competed in a speech contest tonight sponsored by <a href="http://toastmasters.org">Toastmasters</a> International. Although, I didn’t win the contest, I was quite happy with my speech performance. The delivery and the presentation was the best I have given for this particular speech.</p>

<p>I have given this speech a total of three times and each time I felt I’ve greatly improved with the best one given at the contest. So, I am quite pleased with my efforts. There were two very encouraging comments after the contest. One lady approached me and wanted to have a copy of my speech.</p>

<p>So, I gave her my notes. Another guy told me that I should consider becoming an announcer because my voice is very pleasing and it carries quite well in a big room. That was a surprise to me. I thought he was kidding at first, but then he looked serious and he really meant it.</p>

<p>I’ll take that as a complement. I’m not sure if I want to pursue that at this time. But, a very encouraging night indeed.</p>
