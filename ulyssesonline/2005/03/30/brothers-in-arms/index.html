    <p>I bought my brother for his birthday a PC game called “<a href="http://www.brothersinarmsgame.com/uk/index.php">Brothers in Arms, Road to Hill 30</a>” by <a href="http://www.ubi.com/US/">Ubisoft</a>. It’s a WW2 game based on a real story. You get to play Sgt. Matt Baker and his squad of the 101st Airborne Paratroopers before and after the invasion of Normandy.</p>

<p>Sgt. Matt Baker is a soft spoken man who must choose between the success of his mission and the lives of his men – his brothers in arms. The game has over 20 characters with each with his own unique personality, appearance and style. The game is tactical, meaning as a sergeant you can order your men to supress fire, manuever, flank and kill.</p>

<p>The events, maps, battlefield and equipment are accurate and historically detailed based on reconnaisance and eyewitness accounts. Ubisoft should know. The game is based in their backyard in France. There’s also a multi-player game mode in which you play other Brother-in-Arms nuts online. This I haven’t tried yet.</p>

<p>I played this game more than my brother has at this time. Nice gift! It’s like having your cake and eating it, too. Don’t mistake me as a war-monger. You need an outlet everyone in a while. I chose this one. I usually play <a href="http://www.easports.com/games/madden2005/pccd.jsp">Madden 05</a> or <a href="http://www.easports.com/games/fifa2005/pccd.jsp">FIFA Soccer</a>. In this game, I live war vicariously through these characters and it has given me new appreciation for soldiers and the things they go through.</p>

<p>I have to admit I’m playing the easiest level and I have died at least six times already. What this tells me is I wouldn’t have survived WW2 if I had enlisted. The game is quite realistic. If you are looking for a tactical game with lots of action, give this a try. I give this game 4 bullets of out 5 if this was a review, which it isn’t.</p>

<p>Not a bad game considering it’s from a French company. Oops, low blow! I know my friend will never forgive me for buying a French product.</p>
