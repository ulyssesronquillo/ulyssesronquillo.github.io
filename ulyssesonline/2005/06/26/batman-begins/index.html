    <p>I have seen Batman Begins twice already since it opened last weekend. In my opinion, it’s the best Batman movie so far. Christian Bale in my humble opinion is better than Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer or George Clooney. Bale’s character seems more darker and human. The portrayal to exact revenge for his parents murder at the beginning of the movie showed his life’s modus operandi, to fight crime.</p>

<p>Of course, being slapped twice by a girl in the movie was hilarious. I would have liked to see the character of scarecrow be more developed. At the end, Joker is introduced. Maybe, we can have Jack Nicholson to play Joker again. Maybe, even bring back Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones as well.</p>
