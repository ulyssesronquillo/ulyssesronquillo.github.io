    <p>If you have been to any <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodnano/">iPod Nano</a> Forum lately, you probably have noticed a growing complaint against the Nano, a screen that scratches easily. I’m not sure if <a href="http://apple.com">Apple</a> will do anything. Maybe, a total recall. I wish. If they do, I would like to include my <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipodphoto/">iPod Photo</a>. The screen of the iPod Photo gets easily scratched as well.</p>

<p>In fact, this is my second iPod Photo. The first unit I received was replaced. I returned it to an <a href="http://store.apple.com/1-800-MY-APPLE/WebObjects/AppleStore/">Apple store</a> in Palo Alto since it was scratched by an Apple employee while putting on a case protector that I bought from the store. Since then, I have gotten several scratches on my iPod Photo. I don’t recall dropping or scratching the unit. The fact is iPod units scratch easily.</p>

<p>Scratches are especially annoying to iPods with Photos that need to display images on the screen. Any scratch will only distort the images on the screen. I think the iPod as a whole is a delicate product. Even the metal casing scratches easily. Is there a reason why this guy holds the Nano like <a href="http://www.apple.com/">this</a>? Hmmm.</p>

<p>Follow up: Apple recently announced it will repair the broken screens for free!</p>
