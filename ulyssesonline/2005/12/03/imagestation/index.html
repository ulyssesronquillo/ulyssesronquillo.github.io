    <p>I’ve selected a few prints to send to friends who prefer to see photographs the old fashion way (not online). I have a color printer capable of printing photos. I could try that, but I’m no too thrilled about the quality. Plus, the cost of buying more photo paper may not be warranted if I’m printing only a few pictures.</p>

<p>I have several options. <a href="http://fedexkinkos.com">Kinkos</a>‘ has stations for printing, but the cost is $0.49 for a 4 x 6 print. A bit expensive. So, I decided to look elsewhere. I went to <a href="http://shutterfly.com">Shutterfly</a> which I have used before many years ago. I also looked at <a href="http://kodakgallery.com">KodakGallery</a> and <a href="http://imagestation.com">ImageStation</a>.</p>

<p>The prices for printing 4 x 6 prints are affordable. Shutterfly charges $0.19, while KodakGallery charges for $0.15 and ImageStation at $0.12. I went with ImageStations since it was backed by Sony and it is also the cheapest. It wouldn’t hurt trying it out.</p>

<p>ImageStation gives you an option to pick up your photos at any <a href="http://ritz.com">Ritz Camera</a> near you, in my case the San Francisco Bay Area. I opted for a home delivery since I didn’t want to drive 10 or so miles to the nearest Ritz Camera store.</p>

<p>Well, the jury is still out since I’m still waiting for the prints to arrive via standard mail. I’ll keep you updated later.</p>
