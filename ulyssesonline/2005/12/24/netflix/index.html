    <p>I received my first <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> DVD the other day. I’ve heard of Netflix from my friend more than two years ago, but I never tried it until now. Netflix has this trial period where you can rent as many DVDs you like for two weeks. If you don’t like to continue, just cancel before the trial period expires.</p>

<p>Why did I sign up now? Well, I’m not much of a movie goer or DVD movie watcher. I hardly purchase DVDs except for an occassional surfing video. I’m more of a web guy. But ocassionally, I watch movies to break up the monotony of the web. I also wanted to catch up with movies my friends recommend as well as catch up with several surf videos on the market.</p>

<p>Netflix offers customers different types of subscriptions. You can rent 3 DVDs at a time for $17.99 per month. It’s unlimited meaning you can rent as many DVDs that you like. The catch is to return the 3 DVDs as quickly as possible to receive a new set of DVDs. Netflix offers free shipping both ways using the supplied pre-paid envelopes.</p>

<p>There are other options: 2 DVDs at a time for $14.99 per month or 1 DVD at a time for $9.99 per month. There’s also a limited version for $11.99 where you receive 2 DVDs at a time, but limited to 4 DVDs per month. So, there you go. There are lots of choices for a movie buff.</p>

<p>I went with $9.99 option since I don’t watch movies that much. Watching a movie once or twice in a week is good enough for me. The average turn around time for DVDs is about 3 days. It takes a day for the DVD to arrive at your house and another day to ship it back. You’ll get your next DVD 3 days later.</p>

<p>One last thing, Netflix allows you to place all your the movies you want to rent in a queue. So, don’t forget to replenish your queue.</p>
