    <p>Now that Blatter is gone, the 2022 Qatar World Cup should be next. If FIFA wants to make an meaningful impression that it’s really changing for the better, then it needs to make a statement by suspending the 2022 Qatar World Cup. The Qatar selection is the epitome of bribery and corruption. It doesn’t bode well for FIFA to be associated with the Qatar World Cup. Otherwise if the World Cup venue doesn’t change, then people perception of FIFA will never change.</p>

<p>In addition, FIFA structure and voting process also need to change. Currently, every country with a FIFA membership gets one vote. FIFA should heavily weight the voting selection to the 32 teams that make it to the World Cup. After all, they are they are ones involved in the big tournament. Whether how much of a percentage is to be debated? Maybe 75% of the vote, while the rest of the membership gets the other 25%. This will make the perennial teams that qualify in the World Cup regularly have more say and better representation.</p>

<p>This change in the voting process changes the dynamics of FIFA. Football minnows will now have less say, perhaps forging a way in making it much difficult for bribery and corruption. Whether major changes will ever be instituted in FIFA is tough to say. We are talking about a group that’s deeply entrenched in the bribery and corruption for decades. Maybe only a massive purge of the entire institution can save FIFA.</p>
