<meta name="description" content="Is the iPad Pro a PC killer? Not so fast. Initial tests indicate that the iPad Pro is fast, but not as fast as a laptop. And this whole notion that the iPad will replace the PC is ludicrous. It won’t. Businesses and individuals won’t jump out all of a sudden and abandon their desktops for the iPad Pro. I guarantee it, people will still use the desktop for certain tasks. We welcome the vast improvement that Apple has given the iPad, but in the end, it’s still a tablet, for now. And tablets do what tablets do. There are not desktops. Not yet, anyway. Although, the distinction between the two will most likely blur in the future. Most people’s workflow does not translate on the iPad at the moment. Try to work on the iPad for an entire week without ever touching your desktop, and you get the idea. It’s not quite there yet. And I’m not sure if it’s even going to be there in the future. It’s like trying to mold a small car into becoming a pickup. There are certain things tablets do very well. There are certain tasks that desktops do very as well. I don’t think that moment is now." />
