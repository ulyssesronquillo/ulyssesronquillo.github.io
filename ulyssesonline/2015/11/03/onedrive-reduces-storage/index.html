<meta name="description" content="Microsoft learned the hard way what “unlimited storage” means. It didn’t take long for individuals to take advantage of such deals. I heard that some were storing as much 75 TB of data online. Microsoft is now reneging on the unlimited plans and are reducing them to just 1TB. Meanwhile, the free plans are being reduced from 15 GB to just 5GB. For paid plans, the 100 GB and 200 GB plans are going away and will be replaced by 50 GB plan for $1.99 per month. If you’re a OneDrive user who’s exceeded the limited storage, at least Microsoft is giving you an entire year to move off your data to an alternative storage. My favorite part of this intriguing story is Microsoft’s explanation to the reasons why it’s reducing its storage offering. They said it was done “in pursue of collaboration and productivity.” Ok, that does makes a lot of sense. Who are you fooling?" />
