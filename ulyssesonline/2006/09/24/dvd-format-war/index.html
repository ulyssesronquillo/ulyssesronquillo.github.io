<meta name="description" content="The DVD war is beginning to take shape. Hardware manufacturers have been split whether to use the HD-DVD or Blue-Ray format. Several other formats are coming into the fray to join the two leading DVD formats. A third option is a hybrid of the HD-DVD and Blue-Ray formats. There are many reasons to hold off on purchasing a high-definition DVD player. First, the price of the DVD players are still quite high. It will come down eventually. Second, I would rather sit in the sidelines until a clear winner comes out. There’s no sense of buying a high-priced player that might not be popular in the future. The only downside of the new DVD format is the sheer size of the file which makes them longer to download reminiscent of when people had low speed internet connections. Try downloading a 30 to 50 gigabyte movie and you get the picture. Maybe, you won’t get the picture." />
