    <p>I can’t believe it has been five years since the events of 9/11. I still remember vividly the day of the worst attack ever on US soil. I saw it live on TV when the second airplane hit the World Trade Center tower. I saw people leaping out of the towers. I saw the both World Trade Towers collapse. It was an awful day. Today, it hurts even just thinking about it. Some TV networks are replaying the whole event in its entireity. I’m not so sure if I want to watch it all over again.</p>

<p>Many people are asking, “Are we any safer now?” In some ways, we are. We haven’t been attacked since that dreadful day. We are currently battling two wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq. Many people will try to politicize the war in Iraq. We are there and I don’t see us pulling out anytime soon. I’m not worried about our military or even about military spending. What I’m more worried about is home.</p>

<p>We need a safer America. I hope we can continue to be vigilant at home. We need to shore up our borders to prevent another 9-11. If that involves fixing our immigration laws, so be it. We also need pursue the Islamic fundamentalist sympathisers who are already living in this country. Lastly, we need to represent one voice to the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Is this asking too much?</p>
