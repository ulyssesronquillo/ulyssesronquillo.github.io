    <p>I’ve downloaded all the previous shows from Apple iTunes and I’m now caught up with the show. The show opens up with Michael struggling to accept his father, Aldo Burrows who abandoned him as a child. Michael quickly learns from his father that Dr. Sara Tancredi holds the key that could implicate his brother Lincoln Burrows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Sara Tancredi escapes from being killed by Agent Kellerman by jumping off the second story hotel room unto a parked car. She’s hurt, but mends herself. Kellerman’s boss Bill Kim is now hot on Kellerman’s collar.</p>

<p>Agent Mahone tracks down Michael, Lincoln, Aldo and Fernando Sucre. Mr. Burrows is shot by Mahone and dies. Mahone gets a tip from a Mexican coyote about a getaway plane. The getaway plane leaves with Fernando Sucre in it. Michael and Lincoln made a last minute decision to stay.</p>

<p>The plane is now being tracked down by a private jet plane. Meanwhile, C-Note’s wife is arrested while buying medicine for their daughter. Former prison guard captain Brad Bellick is arrested by the local police for the murder of his friend and former prison guard Roy Grady.</p>

<p>Mahone tracks down Michael and Lincoln. Mahone crashes his car to Lincoln and Michael’s car. Lincoln is hurt but not seriously. Mahone gets out of the car and have the two clearly in his sights. Sara is on the other end of the line but Michael can’t get to the cell phone that ended up on the ground after the crash.</p>

<p>The show is getting more interesting every minute. Next week’s episode is the last one for this fall season. It promises to have more twists and turns. We will see.</p>
