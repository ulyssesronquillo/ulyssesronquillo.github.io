    <p>Way to start the Fall Season finale! Michael and Lincoln were caught by the local authorities. Thanks to FBI agent Mahone who wanted the two brothers killed, but the local cops arrived in the nick of time before Mahone could pull the trigger.</p>

<p>Fernando Sucre jumps out of the plane and parachutes down before the plane could be shot down. He lands safely. Unfortunately, the pilot’s parachute fails to open.</p>

<p>Former prison guard captain Brad Bellick is held without bail for the murder of ex-prison guard Roy Grady. Bellick pleads and gets a lighter sentence. He goes back to Fox Penitentiary, this time around as an inmate.</p>

<p>Sarah calls Michael, but there is no answer. She leaves him a message and tells him she needs him. She learns later that Michael and Lincoln were caught and are being transported back to the Fox River Penitentiary. She cuts her hair and gets a new identity.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Tea Bag gets a new prosthetic hand. He meets a postal worker, but murders her after getting a forwarding address of a former girlfriend who was responsible for sending him to prison. Tea Bag shows up later at her door. Its trouble.</p>

<p>While Michael and Lincoln are being transported back to Fox River, the caravan of cars and vans were stopped in the tunnel by a jack-knifed truck. A locked is deliberately let loose. One of the guards leaves a set of keys in the van. It’s smells like a setup by Mahone. He wants the brothers killed. The brothers don’t bite initially, but decided to run for it in the end.</p>

<p>Mahone is conspiring with Kellerman’s help. They trapped the two brothers. In a surprising turn of events, Kellerman kills Mahone and urges the brothers to go with him to implicate the President.</p>

<p>What a finale! You’ll just have to stay tuned for the next show on January 22!</p>
