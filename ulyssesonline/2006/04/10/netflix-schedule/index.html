    <p>I signed up with <a href="http://netflix.com">Netflix</a> a couple of months ago. I selected their lowest plan of $9.95 knowing full well that watching three movies in one night at a higher plan of $19.95 was to me a bit excessive. So, I figured receiving just one movie per shipment was the ideal choice. Or is it? Well, at first I thought, I could potentially watch two movies a week if I was fast enough in returning movies the very next day after watching it. Well, even with a rigid schedule, it doesn’t always work out the way as planned. Here’s a scenario.</p>

<p><strong>Mon</strong>: receive movie Bruce Almighty and watch it at night.<br />
<strong>Tue</strong>: return Bruce Almighty.<br />
<strong>Wed</strong>: Netflix receives Bruce Almighty and ships Sea Biscuit.<br />
<strong>Thu</strong>: receive Sea Biscuit and watch it at night.<br />
<strong>Fri</strong>: return Sea Biscuit.<br />
<strong>Sat</strong>: Netflix is close for business.<br />
<strong>Sun</strong>: Netflix is close for business. Post Office is closed.<br />
<strong>Mon</strong>: Netflix receives Sea Biscuit and ships Sin City.<br />
<strong>Tue</strong>: receive Sin City.</p>

<p>And the cycle continues ad nauseum.</p>

<p>At best, I can watch two movies in 8 days. The best turnaround time is early in the week in just three days, while the worst turnaround time is over the weekend taking over 5 days when Netflix and Post Office are closed for business. I’m wondering how fast shipment is to other parts of the country since I just happen to live just 25 miles away from Netflix’s headquarters in Los Gatos. I figured the delays would be longer.</p>

<p>I still think its a good deal at $9.95.</p>
