    <p>It’s time once again to set our clocks forward by one hour. A note to clock manufacturers: manufacture clocks that automatically adjusts to Daylight Savings Time. It would save me at least a couple of hours of setting the time twice a year. Every device nowadays has a clock. Clocks are ubiquitous. It dominates our life. Just count how many clocks do you have to set every six months. I have four watches, four computers, two cars, a coffeemaker, a stove, a refrigerator, a speedometer, an iPod, two radios, a TV, a Tivo receiver and the list goes on and on. I think it’s criminal to let set the clocks forward and backwards twice a year.</p>

<p>I propose that we do away with Daylight Savings Time. Originally, DST was enforced to help farmers to have more daylight time to get more work done, but we are no longer an agrarian society. There are fewer and fewer farmers each year as big corporations have gobbled up small farmers across America. Also, animals don’t observe DST, but farmers have to adjust their schedules. Others may argue that DST saves electricity. I don’t buy it. The fact remains that regardless of what time of the year, there is the same amount of daylight with or without DST. There are already a couple of states that do not observe DST, Arizona and Indiana. So, why not join them.</p>

<p>To read more about the rationale behind DST and its criticisms, read what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time#Rationales_for_DST">Wikipedia</a> has to say. I think it’s a wash. The benefits do not outweigh the criticism. So, why even have it at all.</p>
