    <p>The US Mens National Team tied Jamaica last night with a score of 1-1. The soccer match was played in preparation for this summer’s World Cup final to be played in Germany. The US team that had been called up were completely made up of MLS players. The European-based players were left off since the game was not an unofficial FIFA international match date. Nonetheless, the USA team had players that were being evaluated for a final roster spot. I would say most of them will have a role of backup in the World Cup.</p>

<p>US Manager Bruce Arena seemed to be experimenting with the lineups by placing outside back Chris Albright at left back position and then swapping him to the right with right back Frankie Hejduk after halftime. Another interesting move was placing defensive midfielder Pablo Mastroeni in central defense.</p>

<p>Jamaica surprised the US by scoring early in the match to take the lead at 1-0. The US pushed up their central backs for a set play, but Jamaica regained position and caught the napping US defense with a quick counter. Right back Frankie Hejduk allowed a Jamaican player to slip through and beat goalkeeper Tony Meola who played tonight for his 100th cap.</p>

<p>I thought the US were lucky to even the score mainly because of the comedy of errors by Jamaican keeper Donovan Ricketts who can’t seem to hold on to any balls sent his way. The Jamaican misadventures were very entertaining for a very unintertaining game.</p>

<p>I think this game totally exposed the lack of quality players the US currently have after the first 14 to 15 guys to be able to compete with the best teams of the world. The players that didn’t help their cause were Josh Wolf, Taylor Twellman, Brian Ching and Frankie Hejduk. The players with a mix grade were Chris Albright and Olsen. It was good to see John O’Brien in the mix after so many injuries. I hope he can get his fitness back in time for the World Cup.</p>

<p>Who knows who Bruce Arena will pick for his final 23, but I know there’s a significant dropoff in talent from the starting 11 and the backup players. I hope the US stay card free and injury free in this year’s World Cup finals.</p>
