    <p>The worst thing that could happen to you if you own your own blog is having comment spam. When I first started blogging a couple of years ago, I was rudely introduced to comment spam. I had over 150 junk messages from poker, casinos, sex, porn, drugs and just about anything in this planet. Thanks to how <a href="http://google.com">Google</a> rank websites. The more links you have, the higher the ranking. So, I spent a couple of hours deleting the spam comments.</p>

<p>The spam comments war had started. First, I tried blocking several IPs that were targeting me, but that was too much work and there were just too many of them. It was like catching a swarm of locusts. Then I started using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captcha">Captcha</a>, but people hated using it. I hated using it. At times, it was hard to figure out the distorted text. Then came <a href="http://akismet.com">Akismet</a> when <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a> 2.0 was introduced. Akismet has saved my hide hundreds of times. I have two blogs, this one you are currently reading and my Black-Letterhead theme. Here’s my spam comment stats so far:</p>

<p><a href="http://ulyssesonline.com">http://ulyssesonline.com</a> – 19 spam comments<br />
<a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/blackletterhead">http://ulyssesonline.com/blackletterhead</a> – 165 spam comments</p>

<p>Akismet catches the comment spam and places them in the database for 15 days. You have 15 days to determine if the comment was incorrectly identified as comment spam or not. You can report a “false positive” to Akismet if the comment is legitimate. It has never happened to me yet. After 15 days, Akismet automatically deletes it.</p>

<p>So once again, thanks Akismet! Spam comments seems to be on the <a href="http://akismet.com/blog/2006/03/record-day/">rise again</a>. Akismet has saved my hide again. By the way, I really love the sound of Akismet. With enough creativeness, you can jumble the syllables and literally tell spam comments to KissmetAss goodbye.</p>
