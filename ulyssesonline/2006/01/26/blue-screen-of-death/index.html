    <p>I was at a local Starbucks in San Francisco trying to check my email. Suddlenly, boom! I see the dreaded blue screen of death with the words: “Hardware malfunction. Call your hardware vendor for support. NMI: Channel Check / IOCheck. The system has halted.”</p>

<p>I rebooted several times with no success. After the seventh try, my computer finally recognized the BIOS, but it complained about an IO problem. It automatically went into BIOS setup. I reset the configuration settings to default then rebooted.</p>

<p>Finally, I was able to get into Windows XP, but it didn’t last long. The blue screen of death popped up again. Agh! No sense of going any further. I called Fujitsu Customer Support. The wait was not bad. Only five minutes.</p>

<p>I talked to the customer support guy and he assured me the problem is not hardware as I initially thought. He told me it’s a software problem with the OS, Windows XP. He said there could be a corrupted IO driver. He said, the only way to fix is to re-install.</p>

<p>What! I didn’t agree with him. I asked him if I could go into Safe Mode and backup the data first before doing anything drastic. He said that would be ideal to backup the data first. End of call.</p>

<p>I came home and fired up the computer. Well. Everything seems to be working now even as I write this blog. Maybe it was just a freak one-time event. Maybe, it was the way the planets were lined up earlier this afternoon. Well, I hope it doesn’t happen again.</p>
