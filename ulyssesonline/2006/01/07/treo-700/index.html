    <p><a href="http://palm.com">Palm</a> introduced this week at <a href="http://cesweb.org">CES</a> Las Vegas its latest handheld device called <a href="http://www.palm.com/us/products/smartphones/treo700w/">Treo 700w</a> which is based on the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/default.mspx">Windows Mobile OS</a>. The move is the first step by the company to move away from the Palm operating system. While previous products still run on the Palm OS, the Windows OS based Treo is seen by financial experts as a boon to the Silicon Valley company.</p>

<p>Time will tell if Palm OS die-hards will jump on the bandwagon and abandon their Palm OS devices for the new Windows-based PDA. Palm is main purpose is to target current Windows OS customers away from its rivals. It’s a smart move considering researchers are saying the shipments of the Palm devices have declined sharply.</p>

<p>Initial feedback from early customers have been good except for a couple of complaints. Several have rumbled about a stepback in the screen resolution. The older 650 has a resolution of 320 x 320 while the newer Treo 700w has a resolution of 240 x 240 only.</p>

<p>Another complaint is the new 700w only operates in two frequencies. The older Treo 650 is a worldwide quad-band phone capable of operating at 800/900/1800/1900 Mhz, while the 700w operates only in the US at 800/1900Mhz.</p>

<p>Hey, all the more reason for me to wait for the Tre650 to come down in price. It’s a good thing I waited.</p>
