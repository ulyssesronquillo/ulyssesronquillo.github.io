    <p>It’s official. I’ve completely upgraded to WordPress version 2.0. I didn’t experience any problems although a number of plugins were no longer working such as the Adhesive, Theme Switcher and Static Front Page. I expected a few plugins to fail, but none were critical.</p>

<p>I’m glad to know Exec-PHP and StatTraq are working. I can probably do away with StatTraq since it’s a just a statistical plugin, but Exec-PHP is a must for me since I use quite a bit of PHP code to display the Resume and Links pages.</p>

<p>I’m not enamored with the new Admin Panel. It going to take some time to familiarize myself with the new layout. I’ve also noticed the Admin pages seem to be a tad slower than the previous. One feature I really like is the Preview.</p>

<p>Finally, I find myself struggling with the Rich Text Editor since a few buttons are no longer at my disposal. So, I ended up turning the Rich Text Editor off. My perception is the regular editor seems to be a tad faster and definately much more familiar.</p>

<p>Overall, the upgrade process went reasonably well. The upgrade had minimum impact visually, but it was painful upgrade than usual due to the complete rewrite of WordPress code under the hood. In the future, I would prefer a smoother upgrade.</p>
