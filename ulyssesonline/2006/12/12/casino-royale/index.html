<meta name="description" content="Casino Royale is a very entertaining movie. I like the new Bond, Daniel Craig. He’s got two first names which people will find easy to forget. I did initially. Finally, a Bond with some muscle and grit. This new Bond has blond hair unlike the rest. I like the opening scene, the chase in the construction area. It reminded me of Planet of the Apes. It’s a super human trying to escape from the grasp of Agent 007. What was he thinking? How could he escape? Of course, 007 got the best of him. The rest of the movie was good and entertaining. Just like the rest of the Bond series, it has beautiful women, exotic cars, bad guys and girls and of course, you can’t have a Bond movie without gadgets. From what I know, Casino Royale is the first book in Ian Fleming’s novel series. One thing I would have liked seen in this movie is if they showed how James Bond got started in the world of espionage. Other than that. I give it 4 out of 5 sweating bullets." />
