<meta name="description" content="I have been thinking about switching telephone service to Vonage. They offer unlimited phone calls to anywhere in the continental United States for just $25 a month. The only requirement is you will need a high-speed internet service at your home which most people do since all calls are placed through on the internet. You get voicemail, 3-way calling, call forwarding, 911 as well as transfer your existing number. So, are they worth a look? Vonage has been bleeding red since 2001 and there are showing no signs of turning the company around. Vonage faces stiff competition from eBay’s Skype and Google. In addition, it also competes with telephone and cable television giants. The company’s fate may lie on a likely buyout or takeover. So, is it worth switching?" />
