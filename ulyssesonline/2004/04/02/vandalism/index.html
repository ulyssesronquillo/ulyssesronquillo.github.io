    <p>Ok, so my car was vandalized again. I went to the store this morning and noticed all four of my hubcaps were missing. All I know is whoever is doing this lives nearby. Those punks. I’m really getting sick of this ****. This is not the first time my car was vandalized in this neighborhood.</p>

<p>My car was keyed at least in 3 separate occasions before. One streak is half the length of the car. Another time, someone tried to open the driver door of my car with a pair of scissors. The damage? They left the broken scissor tip in the keyhole rendering the keyhole inoperable.</p>

<p>Now, I can’t use the key to open my door. A few months ago, someone stole my license plates. I had to go to DMV to get new ones. It cost me $16.00 and 3 wasted hours at DMV. Punks! I don’t know who’s doing this, but it’s most likely kids around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>I don’t understand it and I’m at a loss for words with regards to this kind of behavior. These kids resemble terrorists. They love damaging people’s property. The only thing they don’t do is kill people. Who knows? Maybe, they do that also. I just don’t get it. What do you get for destroying or stealing other people’s property? Low lifes.</p>

<p>Life goes on. I’ll just file a report to the police and let the homeowners association know so they both have a record of it. Just let me vent out for a minute or two. Those punks.</p>
