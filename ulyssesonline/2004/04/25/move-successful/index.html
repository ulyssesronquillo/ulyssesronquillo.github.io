    <p>I have moved several components of my website to this site since I’m in the process of re-installing a newer version of Mandrake Linux to my old 400 Mhz machine. I would like to re-install because my old box has a multi-boot function which I want to remove. There is a Windows partition that is hardly used.</p>

<p>I could use another 3-4 GB of disk storage for the Linux partition. Well, the migration of a couple of programs has been successful with a few issues here and there. The Genealogy program has made it through. Of course, I have moved my the News component in PHP-Nuke to World Press, a program which you are now reading. There are many more modifications that I would like to do, but this would suffice for now. It’s working beautifully.</p>
