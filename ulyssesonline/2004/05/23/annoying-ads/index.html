    <p>I just acquired an annoying pop-up called VX2.BETTERINTERNET. I tried removing it by using a couple of adware programs that I have been running on my computer called Ad-aware and Spybot. Well, the annoying ads are still on my computer. It looks like there is no fix right now.</p>

<p>I’ll just have to wait for an software update from Ad-aware and Spybot in the upcoming weeks. What’s seems to be happening? Well, the pop-up ad is using a DLL file which can’t be deleted while Windows is running, so a reboot is required. The removal doesn’t work since the file renames itself before shutdown or in boot up.</p>

<p>So, the annoying pop-up ad remains on my computer. It seems to be harmless, but not sure if the program spys.</p>
