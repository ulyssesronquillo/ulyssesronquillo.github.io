    <p>Last night, I finished the upgrade of my Linux box to Mandrake 10.0. The OS install was very straightforward and I didn’t have any major issues. There were however some minor tweaking needed during the install process.</p>

<p>On the initial install, I set the security level to “medium,” and I couldn’t connect to the internet via a web browser. So, I reinstalled the OS and lowered the security level to “standard.” There were no issues after that. I was able to connect via the web browser. Weird. Not sure what happened there.</p>

<p>Next, I re-installed “ddclient”, a utility that updates the DNS server if your server’s dynamic ip address has changed. This utility is ideal for those who would like to host a server at home, but receive a dynamic ip address from their internet providers. The utility scans for changes in your IP address and reports it to a DNS server.</p>

<p>Your domain name is updated with the new IP address. I downloaded the latest version of “ddclient” and installed it, but I used my old config file. There is no sense in starting all over again from scratch.</p>

<p>I also installed “Gallery”, the online picture album program that I had running previously in my Linux box. I ended up upgrading to the latest version of Gallery. I found out there are many new features. I had to tweak the program to recognize my older albums.</p>

<p>No issues with the configuration except for a couple of warnings for optional items that I don’t need at this time. Well, so far, so good. What’s next? I plan to work on MySQL and PHP-Nuke.</p>
