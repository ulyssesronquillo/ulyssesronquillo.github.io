To note Nintendo was barely a mention a year ago. Over 10.21 millions units have been sold worldwide. Demand is very strong. As a result of brisk sales, Nintendo reported a net profit of 174.29 billion yen ($1.47 billion) in the year through March, up dramatically from 98.38 billion yen a year earlier. Nintendo is predicting 18% rise in profit sales next year. That is probably a very conservative number." />
