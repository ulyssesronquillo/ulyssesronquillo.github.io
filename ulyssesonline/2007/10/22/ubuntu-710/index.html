    <p>I recently upgraded my Linux desktop to <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu710">Ubuntu 7.10</a>. The <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/upgrading">upgrade process</a> took a little over an hour considering the number of packages that were being downloaded and installed. Moving from Ubuntu 7.04 Fiesty Fawn to 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon as they are known to the Ubuntu community, is an extremely easy process. All it takes is a handful of clicks. I suggest that you go for a coffee break while the system is downloading. The download can last up to an hour and that is with a fast internet connection.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/releasenotes/710tour">Ubuntu 7.10 Gutsy Gibbon’s features</a> include: the latest Gnome 2.20, a “fast user switching” utility allowing easy switching of users between sessions, a “NTFS writing” capability allowing Ubuntu users to write to a Windows NTFS file system – a first in Ubuntu, a “desktop search” utility and the “fully automatic printer configuration” just to name a few.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the <a href="http://compiz.org/">Compiz Desktop Effects</a> in my opinion is the biggest draw to Ubuntu 7.10. It’s the eye candy. Unfortunately, the Desktop Effects didn’t work for me from the outset. It was somehow disabled due to my restricted ATI graphic drivers which were not included on Ubuntu’s whitelist. There is no cause for concern. After scouring the forums, I installed the xserver-xgl, compiz and the compiz settings manager to make Desktop Effects work again. Here’s the command if you are interested.</p>

<p>#sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl compiz compizconfig-settings-manager</p>

<p>I’m quite impressed with the Compiz Desktop Effects although the documentation is very skimpy. I had to scour the internet to find some keyboards shortcuts that I badly needed. I hope Ubuntu fixes the issues with the ATI drivers because leaving the <a href="http://forlong.blogage.de/article/2007/10/2/Desktop-effects-by-default-in-Gutsy---how-Compiz-Fusion-enhances-Ubuntus-desktop-of-version-710">Desktop Effects uninstalled</a> is not what I expected with Ubuntu 7.10.</p>
