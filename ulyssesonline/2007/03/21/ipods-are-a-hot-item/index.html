    <p>iPods are a hot item. I meant hot as in stolen. There’s a string of robberies happening in and around the Bay Area for the world’s most popular digital music player. Some people were robbed at knifepoint like the two women who were mugged by a 12 year old boy less than ten minutes apart.

<p>How do you protect yourself? There are some excellent tips from <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/03/21/MNGRUOOVAA1.DTL&amp;type=tech">John Cote article</a> in the <a href="http://sfgate.com">San Francisco Chronicle</a>. I particularly like the one tip about replacing the widely recognizable white Apple earpiece with a commercially available black earpiece. I did this when I traveled to Central America a couple of years ago. No one even knew I had an <a href="http://apple.com">iPod</a>. I also like the tip about keeping the volume down and always being aware of your surroundings. Engraving also helps if your iPod is recovered by police.</p>

<p>Be careful out there.</p>
