<meta name="description" content="One feature I really like about the $150 laptops is the handcrank to charge the battery. I could use that feature now in my laptop since my battery only lasts for about 15 minutes. A couple of turns should be good for another 30 minutes. I also like the keyboard that switches languages automatically. One laptop per child is the goal. Some countries will not be able to afford them. I have a feeling the $150 laptops will end up in the wrong hands and not the children. Another possibility, people will try to make money by selling it in the black market." />
