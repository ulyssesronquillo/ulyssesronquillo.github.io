I seem to be doing WordPress upgrades every month. But despite my bad attitude, WordPress 2.1 seems to be a great improvement over the last version. Check out all the new features of version 2.1. My favorite new features are: auto-save, private pages, faster Admin pages and more Ajax. I played around with the release candidate version last week. It’s time to get my hands on the new release. Maybe, I’ll wait. I see a WordPress 2.1.0.2 release coming. Hehe." />
