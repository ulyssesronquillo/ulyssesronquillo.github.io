    <p>I recently bought a <a href="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/fusion.jpg">new webcam</a> from <a href="http://logitech.com">Logitech</a> called the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2204,CONTENTID=10562">QuickCam Fusion</a>. The USB web camera comes with a 1.3 megapixel sensor capable of delivering high quality video images. The webcam has 7 different screen resolutions from the small 320×240 which is perfect for email attachments to the standard 640×480, 960×720, 1280×960, 1600×1200, 2048×1536 to the enormous 2304×1728 pixels.</p>

<p>The videocam is equipped with a privacy shade which is great for concealing private moments. It also has a snapshot button for quick takes, plus a built-in microphone for making recorded videos an easy task. The videocam has an outstanding low light performance unparalleled to any videocam I’ve used before. In addition, the webcam comes with Logitech’s Video Effects which allow users to personalize the webcam using Avatars or facial accessories.</p>

<p>After the install, I had issues with the Video Effects not working with the videocam after a reboot. Rebooting the PC again does not solve the problem. I ended up uninstalling and reinstalling the video software and the drivers to get them to work again, but the fix was temporary. Eventually, the problem would surfaced again after a reboot.</p>

<p>It took me a couple of days until I pinpointed two offending drivers that had conflicts with the Logitech videocam driver. The two drivers are: <strong>sbdrvdet.exe</strong>, a Soundblaster driver which detects if someone is using the audio front-panel of the internal drive bay and <strong>rcman.exe</strong>, a remote control driver for the Audigy or Creative Media Source sound cards which allows remote control play back of music.</p>

<p>Both drivers are non-essential and can be disabled from the Windows Startup Script. Both drivers can be manually enabled if really needed. At least now, the Video Effects features are working.</p>
