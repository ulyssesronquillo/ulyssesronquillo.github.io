<meta name="description" content="So, what really happened in the last episode of the Sopranos? All of the sudden, the camera goes black in the most inopportune moment leaving the TV audience at the edge of their seats with questions as to what really happened. The sudden abrupt end leads to many questions unanswered especially since all night long the episode had this dark ominous feeling to it that something bad was going to happen to Tony. When the screen went black, the show is over. That’s it. No one knows for sure what happened, but I think the audience got whacked. I hope it stays this way for eternity. No sequels. No follow ups. No explanation. A perfect ending to a hit… TV series that is." />
