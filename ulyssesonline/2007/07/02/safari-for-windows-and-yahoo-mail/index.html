    <p>Well, after playing around with Safari for Windows the last several days, I found a few quirks and issues that could prevent many people from switching to the <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/download/">Safari Windows browser</a>. First and firemost, and probably the most important is Yahoo Mail. I tried reading Yahoo Mail with the Safari browser and I got this message saying, “Hmm…your browser is not officially supported.” But, then again this is <a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">Yahoo Mail</a> Beta running on a Safari Beta browser. Well, I’m not surprised by the result.</p>

<p>The second challenge is <a href="http://bigsoccer.com">BigSoccer.com</a> website — the soccer freak that I am. The menu system on bigsoccer.com’s website does not work in Safari. I don’t particularly know what kind of menu system they use, but all I know is, it doesn’t work in Safari. By the way, I am annoyed with their banner ads because sometimes it places the menu in the background, behind the ads, making it impossible to make a menu selection. And this is with a good browser, with Firefox. That website has issues, but that’s another story. But, I love bigsoccer.</p>
