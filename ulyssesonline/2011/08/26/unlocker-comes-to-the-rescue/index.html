<meta name="description" content="I recently had to access my Windows XP partition, which at this point in time, happens very rarely. Anyways, while browsing around the file system, I noticed two odd directories that look suspiciously out of place. I say delete them! Unfortunately, Windows XP won’t allow me delete these two directories. It says I have no permission, even though I am the administrator. I even booted into Safe Mode with Command Prompt. It simply won’t allow me to delete files. What’s up with that? It’s annoying to say the least. So, I downloaded Unlocker after a quick search online. When you launch Unlocker, it will give you the file directory structure. All you have to do is select a directory or file, and then choose the action to take. In my case, I want to delete. Well, after about a minute or two, the directories were gone. Awesome program for deleting directories and files that simply refuse to be deleted." />
