<p>From: torvalds@klaava.Helsinki.FI (Linus Benedict Torvalds)<br />
Newsgroups: comp.os.minix<br />
Subject: What would you like to see most in minix?<br />
Summary: small poll for my new operating system<br />
Message-ID:<br />
Date: 25 Aug 91 20:57:08 GMT<br />
Organization: University of Helsinki</p>

<p>Hello everybody out there using minix â€“</p>

<p>Iâ€™m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, wonâ€™t be big and<br />
professional like gnu) for 386(486) AT clones. This has been brewing<br />
since april, and is starting to get ready. Iâ€™d like any feedback on<br />
things people like/dislike in minix, as my OS resembles it somewhat<br />
(same physical layout of the file-system (due to practical reasons)<br />
among other things).</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve currently ported bash(1.08) and gcc(1.40), and things seem to work.<br />
This implies that Iâ€™ll get something practical within a few months, and<br />
Iâ€™d like to know what features most people would want. Any suggestions<br />
are welcome, but I wonâ€™t promise Iâ€™ll implement them ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Linus (torvalds@kruuna.helsinki.fi)</p>

<p>PS. Yes â€“ itâ€™s free of any minix code, and it has a multi-threaded fs.<br />
It is NOT protable (uses 386 task switching etc), and it probably never<br />
will support anything other than AT-harddisks, as thatâ€™s all I have :-(.</p>
