<p>It just shows you that online services such as Dropbox, and social sites such as Facebook and Twitter are not 100% secure. If you’re concerned about the security, then you shouldn’t really place any highly sensitive information on any of the online services. If you must, then you should use the highest encryption standard you can find. I recommend that you use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES-256</a> encryption. If you’re a Windows user, you can use the popular compression program called <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7Zip</a>. For Linux or Ubuntu users, you will find more information here in this <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=385540">forum</a>.</p>
