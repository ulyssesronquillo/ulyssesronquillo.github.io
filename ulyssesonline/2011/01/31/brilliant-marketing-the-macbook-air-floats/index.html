    <p>I saw this video from <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5748031/no-seriously-the-macbook-air-is-this-light">Gizmodo</a> this morning. It shows the MacBook Air suspended by a single balloon at a Mac store. Is it for real? Is the MacBook Air really that light? After a few seconds, I realized there is no way a single balloon that small can suspend a 2 lb MacBook Air in the air . It would take a few more balloons than that. That is some hot air.</p>

<p>Actually, it will take more than hot air to suspend a MacBook Air. Helium doesn’t cut it. Perhaps hydrogen. It’s just that the balloon is just too small to buck gravity with a 2lb payload. Notice the balloon doesn’t move at all. As it turns out, the balloon is actually suspended by a string.</p>

<p>Here are some of the funny and interesting comments from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I walked by the apple store yesterday. The balloon was suspended by wires.</p>

  <p>Kind of ruins the illusion when you’re leaving work late one night, and you see a bunch of Apple employees hanging up the baloon by fish wire.</p>

  <p>Although this is obviously held up by some wires, it would be interesting to see how many balloons it takes to get it off the ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And of course, some mathematician tries to explain it all.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MacBook Air: 1060 grams<br />
Approximate volume: 0.68*29.95*19.2=391 cm^3<br />
Average Balloon: 11410 cm^3<br />
Average Balloon: 16.3 grams</p>

  <p>Total volume: 11801 cm^3<br />
Total mass: 1076 grams</p>

  <p>Density of MBA: 0.09117 g/cm^3 (STP)<br />
Density of Air: 0.00128 g/cm^3 (STP)</p>

  <p>The MacBook Air and balloon are 70 times denser than air, and therefore, will not float.</p>

  <p>Please check my math.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yea, somebody check his math.</p>

<p>I say this is brilliant marketing from Apple. Now, I really believe the MacBook Air is really that light. I own one.</p>
