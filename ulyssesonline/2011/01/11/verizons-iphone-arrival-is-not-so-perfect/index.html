    <p>Verizon plans to announce today the arrival of the iPhone. But, the scenario not quite perfect as everyone thought it would be. Verizon plans to run the iPhone 4 on its ‘3G’ network, and not on the faster ‘4G’ network. It’s disappointing if you ask me. To make matters worse, the timing of it is not quite so ideal. Let me explain.</p>

<p>The next generation of iPhones, the iPhone 5, will probably be released later this summer. It would be nice if the iPhone 5 coincides with Verizon release later this month, but we all know that will not happen. Can Verizon wait until summer? One problem. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110111/ap_on_hi_te/us_tec_verizon_iphone_winners_and_losers;_ylt=AopxwWH4O.OA7x12Ie7mF_QjtBAF;_ylu=X3oDMTM5YWJnNmxoBGFzc2V0A2FwLzIwMTEwMTExL3VzX3RlY192ZXJpem9uX2lwaG9uZV93aW5uZXJzX2FuZF9sb3NlcnMEY3BvcwMxBHBvcwMzBHNlYwN5bl90b3Bfc3RvcnkEc2xrA2Z1bGxuYnNwc3Rvcg--">Rumor</a> has it that Verizon will not have access to the iPhone 5 until the end of the year, which gives AT&amp;T a six month advantage.</p>

<p>I’m sure Verizon’s executives are not happy with this scenario. But, they don’t really have a choice, it’s either release it now or at wait until the end of the year. And waiting until the end of the year is not really an option. So, reports of the demise of AT&amp;T, in terms of losing million of users to Verizon, is far from becoming reality.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, maybe it’s the deal that Apple wanted with both carriers. It was really meant to be this way. It satisfies both carriers, without sacrificing the other.</p>
