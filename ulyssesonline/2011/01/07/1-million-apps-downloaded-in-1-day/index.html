    <p>One million were apps downloaded from the Mac App Store in in just one day. It’s quite impressive. You can add me as one contributor to that statistic. I’ve downloaded a couple of applications in Twitter and TextWrangler. Both were free. The Mac App Store features the top paid and free programs in the store. So, it’s interesting to see which apps are popular. You get a feel for what apps are trending.</p>

<p>Just a couple of applications worth noting.</p>

<p>MindNode for Mac is a elegant mindmapping application for collecting, organizing and outlining your thought and ideas. It’s a perfect tool for brainstorming, holiday planning, research, writing, project management, and meeting notes. The best part of it all is, it’s free. Can’t beat that. I’ve used a mindmapping tool before in my previous work to brainstorm and organize thoughts. I even used it for talks and speeches.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with HDR images at all, you wonder how it is done. Well, Light Compressor is an app that lets you easily combine multiple exposures into striking HDR images. Light Compressor will combine the images you’ve taken from a tripod and give you the freedom to tweak the color curves, the tone-mapping and saturation before saving it as high quality 16 bit/channel tiff image. This app is practically free for just $0.99.</p>

<p>Well, everyone knows Angry Birds. If you don’t, no worries. Angry Birds is the number one paid app in the Mac App Store. At just $4.99, you can download and play this hugely popular game. Dish out revenge on those green pigs that stole the bird’s eggs. Lots of angry birds here. The game features 195 levels. It’s well worth the price. If you ever need a break from work, go play this game.</p>
