    <p>You probably seen several ugly websites in your lifetime. But this one is the tops. Its clearly the most hideous website ever. The worst! If you can come up with something worse than this, let me know. When was this website exactly coded? Hmmm, based on web design forensics, it looks like these pages precede the pre-1994 era of the Internet age. Here’s some of its glorious features:</p>

<p>A guestbook! No one has been using a guestbook for years. Background music! At least, the honky tonk music will keep you entertained while surfing the site. The colors! No one has seen these color combinations in ages. You probably need a trip to the eye doctor after 5 minutes on this site.</p>

<p>Overlapping images! After all, you can’t fit them all in one page. It looks like these photos were taken when digital cameras had resolutions of 100×150 pixels. Of course, every site has to have Cessna planes and Harley motorcycle background images. How about a screenshot!</p>

<p><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/worst-ever-e1294441803389.png" alt="" title="worst-ever" /></p>

<p>No amount of screenshot is going to do any justice to this masterpiece, until you see it for yourself. So, I present to you, the most <a href="http://yvettesbridalformal.com/">hideous website ever</a>. And don’t tell me I didn’t warn you.</p>

<p>Finally, an apology for the overuse of the exclamation point!!</p>
