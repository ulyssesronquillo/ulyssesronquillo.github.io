    <p>Will the iPhone finally come to Verizon near you? This rumor has been circulating for years. Is it finally coming true? I can’t believe, that it has been 3 1/2 years since the iPhone was introduced with AT&amp;T as sole partner in June 2007. How time flies. Apple and Verizon plan to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704030704576070090093187986.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">announce</a> on Tuesday the new partnership. No details yet. No plans. No prices. I guess we will find out more about it on <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE7072L620110108">Tuesday</a>.</p>

<p>Based on early analyst estimates, Apple will likely add 9 to 12 million new iPhone users on Verizon’s network. The figure will probably equal the number of iPhone units sold via AT&amp;T this past year, estimated to be around 14.5 million units. Does this mean iPhone users will double in 2011? By the looks of it, based on estimates, it probably will.</p>

<p>Will see a max exodus of AT&amp;T users switching over to Verizon? Probably not. After all, it’s not always easy to get out of a contract. Remember, AT&amp;T increased the early termination fee to $325 last year and $10 extra for each month. People would think twice before getting out their current contract. In addition, AT&amp;T also cut the iPhone 3GS phones from $99 to $49 last week. I think AT&amp;T will be fine.</p>
