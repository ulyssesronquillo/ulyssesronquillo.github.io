    <p>Drupal 7 was released today. Drupal is an open-source content management system that powers millions of websites and applications including the White House, InfoWorld, Examiner and cloud-based CMS Drupal Gardens. Drupal 7 enhancements are focused mainly in areas of usability and scalability.</p>

<p>In terms of usability, Drupal 7 comes with a much improved user interface. Drupal 7 also improved in the area of scability. Drupal might be a bit slower than its predecessor Drupal 6, but it can run bigger websites. Examiner.com, who recently moved from ColdFusion to Drupal 7, has over 22.4 million unique visitors monthly.</p>

<p>So, I downloaded and installed Drupal 7 today on my development system running on my laptop. One of the nicer enhancements of Drupal 7 has over the previous versions is that is now faster and cleaner to install. It’s not quite the same as the WordPress’ famous 5 minute install, but it comes very close.</p>

<p>Drupal 7 also comes with OpenID support as well as revamped contact form.</p>

<p>If you’re fortunate enough to be near one of these 900 Drupal release parties, I say go to one of them. I’m planning on going.</p>

<p>One last thing, Mashable made Drupal, one of the top 10 websites in 2011.</p>
