    <p>I just received an email from Reed Hastings, co-founder and CEO of Netflix. Reed initially apologizes for the confusion the last few weeks regarding Netflix’s subscription pricing hike and explains the reasoning behind the increase. He also explains the emerging separate businesses of streaming and DVD. Reed later introduces a new name to DVD business called Qwikster. Here’s an excerpt of the email.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So we realized that streaming and DVD by mail are really becoming two different businesses, with very different cost structures, that need to be marketed differently, and we need to let each grow and operate independently.</p>

  <p>It’s hard to write this after over 10 years of mailing DVDs with pride, but we think it is necessary: In a few weeks, we will rename our DVD by mail service to “Qwikster”. We chose the name Qwikster because it refers to quick delivery. We will keep the name “Netflix” for streaming.</p>

  <p>Qwikster will be the same website and DVD service that everyone is used to. It is just a new name, and DVD members will go to qwikster.com to access their DVD queues and choose movies. One improvement we will make at launch is to add a video games upgrade option, similar to our upgrade option for Blu-ray, for those who want to rent Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 games. Members have been asking for video games for many years, but now that DVD by mail has its own team, we are finally getting it done. Other improvements will follow. A negative of the renaming and separation is that the Qwikster.com and Netflix.com websites will not be integrated.</p>
</blockquote>
