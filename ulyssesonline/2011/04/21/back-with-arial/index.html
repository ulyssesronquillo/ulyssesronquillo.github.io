<meta name="description" content="Ok. I’m officially back with Arial. I have been using Google Fonts, the Ubuntu font, for over a year. I’ve used it with the main text and headers. No complaints here. Performance has been very good. I tried using other Google fonts, but I just didn’t liked any of them. I’ve look into using the TypeKit fonts. My pageviews is way over the 25k per month for the free Trial Library service. I’m just slightly over the Personal Library. So if I were to join, I would have to get a Portfolio with its Full Library for $50 a year. It comes down to about $4 a month. It’s still not bad. But, Google Fonts is free. That’s the reason I was using it for a while. So, now I’m back to good old lean mean Arial. Just a change of scenery. Something different. I might try a different font later on." />
