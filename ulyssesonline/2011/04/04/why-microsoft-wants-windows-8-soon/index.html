    <p>Why is Microsoft in such a hurry to release Windows 8? After all, Windows 7 is barely a year old. It has been 17 months, to be precise, since Windows 7 was released. Most of us still haven’t upgraded to Windows 7 yet. So, why is Microsoft in such a hurry to introduce yet another version of Windows?</p>

<p>The answer could be as simple as Microsoft wanting their hands on ARM-based devices. ARM processors run majority control of today’s smartphones and tablets. Microsoft is obviously playing catch up in the smartphone and tablet arena.</p>

<p>The main issue for Microsoft is that majority of Windows users are still running Windows XP. A whopping 54% still run Windows XP. The good news is that Windows 7 users has <a href="http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/08/windows-7-overtakes-windows-vista.ars">overtaken</a> Windows Vista users since July 2010.</p>

<p>But, majority of Windows XP users are still deferring upgrades. Expect Windows 8 to be released first quarter of 2012.</p>
