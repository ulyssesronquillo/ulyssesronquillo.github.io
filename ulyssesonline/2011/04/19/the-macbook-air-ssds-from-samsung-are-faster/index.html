    <p>According to <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/04/apple-shipping-newer-faster-ssds-in-latest-macbook-airs.ars?comments=1#comments-bar">Ars Technica</a>, Apple is now shipping MacBook Airs with SSDs that are made by Samsung instead of the original SSDs supplied by Toshiba. The switch seems to increase writing and reading performance speeds, on the 2010 MacBook Airs by 20-25 percent, according to tests performed by <a href="http://www.anandtech.com/show/4275/apple-now-using-samsung-ssds-in-macbook-air">AnandTech</a>.</p>

<p>I happen to have the MacBook Air, purchased around early December 2010. I wanted to know if I have the original Toshiba SSD or the new Samsung SSD. Before I digging in, I had a feeling that I had the older SSD. I have been very happy with my MacBook Air since I purchased it. But, knowing if I had the faster SSD would be nice.</p>

<p>Go to the System Profiler by accessing the Apple menu and then clicking About this Mac. Go to the section called Serial-ATA, you will see the Model number of your SSD device. Mine says: APPLE SSD TS128C. That means I have the older Toshiba.</p>

<p>It would have been nice to have the faster Samsung SSD, but I have been very happy with my new MacBook Air’s performance. No complaints here. So the question is, how do I get the new SSDs? Is it even possible to swap devices?</p>
