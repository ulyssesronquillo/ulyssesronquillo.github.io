    <p>EA Sports has finally turned off the online servers for FIFA 2010 on December 6. I have been trying to play online the last couple of days, but it kept saying the servers are down. And I thought the hiccup was due to the recent Xbox 360 update. Unfortunately it wasn’t. It was just <a href="http://www.ea.com/1/service-updates">EA turning off the online service</a> for several games, in which FIFA 2010 is chief among them.</p>

<p>Here’s the service update notes from EA Sports.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The decisions to retire older EA games are never easy. The development teams and operational staff pour their hearts into these games almost as much as the customers playing them and it is hard to see one retired. But as games get replaced with newer titles, the number of players still enjoying the older games dwindles to a level — fewer than 1% of all peak online players across all EA titles — where it’s no longer feasible to continue the behind-the-scenes work involved with keeping these games up and running. We would rather our hard-working engineering and IT staff focus on keeping a positive experience for the other 99% of customers playing our more popular games. We hope you have gotten many hours of enjoyment out of the games and we appreciate your ongoing patronage.</p>

  <p>If you have further questions about your account or the shut down of these services, please visit <a href="http://support.ea.com/">http://support.ea.com</a>.</p>

  <p>Thank you,<br />
Electronic Arts</p>

<p>Oh well, it was good while it lasted. In reality, I just about milked every cent out of that game. It was great fun. In the meantime, it’s time to look for a possible replacement. I heard FIFA 2012 has got rave reviews.</p>
