    <p>Last night, I finally received in the mail, FIFA 12 for the Xbox 360. I ordered it through Amazon since it was $10 cheaper. Shipping was free, but I have to wait 5-7 days for it. It was worth it. I think.</p>

<p>One the reasons I bought this game was, because EA turned off the online servers for FIFA 10. I can no longer play online games, which takes the fun out of it. So, on to the next release, or two.</p>

<p><img src="http://ulyssesonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/fifa12.jpg" alt="" title="fifa12" />I went with FIFA 12. I never considered buying FIFA 11, because I think it nuts to buy the same game every year. Plus the older games are usually supported for a minimum of 2 years.</p>

<p>I probably missed out on all the fun with FIFA 11, but I’m all caught up now. I think. FIFA 12 needs some serious relearning on my part. Playing defense is an entirely different game. You can no longer call for help on defense as much with FIFA 10.</p>

<p>The animation is great. The players moves are more realistic than previous versions. The wild celebrations after a goal is a little overdone. Rooney keeps on getting caught up inside the goal netting, like a shark caught in a fisherman’s net.</p>

<p>Overall, I like the game. It will take a little use to get better with this game. Playing online will come later, when I get better.</p>
