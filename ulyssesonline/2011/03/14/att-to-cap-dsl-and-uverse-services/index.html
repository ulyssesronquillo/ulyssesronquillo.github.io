    <p>AT&amp;T plans to impose limits on its DSL and Uverse services. It will cap 150GB on its DSL service and 250GB for Uverse. This is based on this morning’s <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/is-atts-new-150gb-dsl-data-cap-justified.ars">article</a> by Ars Technica. This affects me and family. We are big Netflix users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AT&amp;T says the move will affect “less than 2 percent” of customers and that it is necessary to address congestion in the network.</p>

  <p>The cap structure is not currently set up to squeeze extra fees out of most users. Subscribers who exceed their monthly allowance will pay an additional $10 for each 50GB over the cap, but AT&amp;T tells Ars that “customers will hear from us directly numerous times before they exceed usage and before they incur any additional fees.”</p>

  <p>The company will notify users when they hit 65 percent, 90 percent, and 100 percent of their monthly caps, and will also provide historical usage reports and a monthly usage tracking tool. (AT&amp;T says that an average DSL user on its network currently transfers 18GB each month.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It gets better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Claims of congestion are notoriously hard to validate from outside the network, but industry analyst Dave Burstein does extensive writing about and consulting for various ISPs; he fired off a <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/DavesNews/status/47075207483109377">tweet</a> this morning saying that AT&amp;T “lied” to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20110313-702321.html"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. “Congestion is minimal,” Burstein said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Capping is now a reality.</p>

<p>It comes at no surprise that AT&amp;T wants more money. It posted $20 billion of net income last year, although more than half came from its wireless service. AT&amp;T will cap use of its DSL, Uverse and wireless services. Comcast already caps its customers at 250GB per month.</p>

<p>Competition squeezed.</p>

<p>What’s even more interesting is, AT&amp;T’s Uverse IPTV and VOIP usage is exempted from the cap. That doesn’t look fair to me. Companies and services like Vonage, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, considered as over-the-top providers are getting squeezed by AT&amp;T and Comcast.</p>
