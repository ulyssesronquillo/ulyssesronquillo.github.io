    <p>It has been a year since I last touched CodeIgniter. At that time, I was working with version 1.7.2. Wanting to get back into it, I revisited the CodeIgniter website last week, and I learned that there is a new version of CodeIgniter, version 2.0.0. Last year, I created three personal projects that helped me learn how CodeIgniter works, as well as learn how MVC frameworks work in general.</p>

<p>I downloaded the latest version of CodeIgniter hoping that I should be able to move my old projects into the new version of CodeIgniter. Needless to say, the move was unsuccessful. I found out there are some significant changes to how CodeIgniter controllers and models are constructed between version 1.7.2 and 2.0.0. I should mention also, that there was a version in between that was released, version 1.7.3.</p>

<p>Here are the major differences in the way controllers and models are constructed between version 1.7.2 and version 2.0.0. In both cases, I’m using class constructors.</p>

<h3 id="version-172">Version 1.7.2</h3>

<h4 id="controllers">Controllers</h4>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pre lang="php"&gt;
class Contact extends Controller {
  function Contact() {
    parent::Controller();
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="models">Models</h4>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pre lang="php"&gt;
class Contact_model extends Model {
  function Contact_model() {
    parent::Model();
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="version-200">Version 2.0.0</h3>

<h4 id="controllers-1">Controllers</h4>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pre lang="php"&gt;
class Contact extends CI_Controller {
  function __construct() {
    parent::__construct();
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Models</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>&lt;pre lang="php"&gt;
class Contact_model extends CI_Model {
  function __construct() {
    parent::__contruct();
  }
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I might add, there are other changes I haven’t even mentioned. The biggest change is the removal of PHP 4 support. Version 2.0.0 requires PHP 5.1.6. Scaffolding is deprecated. Plugins have been removed in favor of Helpers, and few <a href="http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/changelog.html">more</a>.</p>
