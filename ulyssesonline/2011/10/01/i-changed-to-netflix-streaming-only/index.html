    <p>It’s official. I changed my Netflix plan to online streaming only for just $7.99 a month plus the applicable taxes. Most likely $8 and some change. Last month, I was dinged for $17 plus for having both online streaming and DVD rentals. I realized I don’t really turn over that much DVDs in a month that’s worth the extra $7 or $8 bucks, so I made the change. I’m glad I did.</p>

<p>I was one of those people that wanted to sit out for a bit, and decide later on, whether to go with online streaming only, DVD only, or both. I went with online streaming only. Now that I’m made my decision, I think $7.99 and some change is much better for my pocket, I would say, especially in this economy. I’m more than curious as to how many people made the same decision I made.</p>

<p>I assume a large chunk of Netflix users have chosen online streaming over DVD rentals. The question is, will Netflix spin Qwikster as a separate company, or possibly sell it to another company. Clearly, the future of Netflix is in online streaming.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the criticisms that Netflix’ management have gotten over price changes and the splitting of its services, but I think Netflix management has made the right choice going forward.</p>

<p>Now, if they can only let all the DVD movies to be available online. That would make everyone happy.</p>
