    <p>3TB (Terabyte) drives are popping up everywhere. You’ll find them in stores as well as online. If you’re thinking about getting a 3TB hard drive, they may not work completely the way you imagined it. There are some older PCs and not-so-old operating systems (Windows 7) that do not support 3TB drives. Don’t worry, you will still get 3 TB capacity you paid for, but not in one volume. You will most likely get a 2.2 TB volume and a 800MB volume.</p>

<p>You will have this problem if you have an older BIOS and are running any of the following operating systems: Windows XP, 32-bit Windows Vista and 32-bit Windows 7. The OS that supports 3TB drives are the 64-bit Windows Vista and 64-bit Windows 7, MacOS and Linux.</p>

<h3 id="legacy-addressing-problem">Legacy Addressing Problem</h3>

<p>The problem stems from the legacy addressing problem detailed by <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/235088/everything_you_need_to_know_about_3tb_hard_drives.html#tk.hp_fv">PCWorld</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The problem with deploying 3TB drives relates to older PCs (those more than a few months old, in most cases), and stems from the formula 2^32*512=2,199,023,255,552, or 2.2TB–a hard-drive addressing scheme found in legacy BIOSs and operating systems. In that formula, 2 indicates binary, 32 is the number of bits allowed in a legacy disk address, and 512 is the number of bytes in a legacy hard-drive data block. If the BIOS, drivers, I/O card, or operating system in your PC still plays by rules that involve this formula, you’ll have issues installing and using a 3TB drive.</p>

  <p>This situation could have been avoided if the entire computer industry had future-proofed after enduring the <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/55983/hard_drives_100gb_and_larger.html">137GB (28-bit) limit problems</a> that cropped up around the turn of the millennium. In truth, most vendors did–with the notable exception of Microsoft. The company chose not to implement support for anything larger than 2.2TB drives in any of its 32-bit consumer operating systems–including Windows 7. Microsoft even omitted support from 64-bit XP. If you were looking for a reason to move to <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/207851/32_vs_64_what_bit_windows.html">64-bit Windows 7</a>, here it is–courtesy of a not so subtle (or particularly gracious) invitation from the industry giant.</p>

<h3 id="microsoft-dropped-the-ball">Microsoft Dropped the Ball</h3>

<p>This is just another example of Microsoft dropping the ball. It also gives the perception that Microsoft is trying to squeeze more from people by recommending to upgrade to their latest and greatest OS. By the way, MacOS and Linux doesn’t have this legacy addressing issue since they have addressed them many years ago. So, if you’re in the market for a 3TB drive, better check what OS you are running, because you might end up with two annoying volumes instead of one. Here’s a list of supported and unsupported OS with 3TB drives.</p>

<h3 id="3tb-supported">3TB Supported</h3>

<p>64-bit Windows Vista, 64-bit Windows 7, MacOS, Linux</p>

<h3 id="3tb-unsupported">3TB Unsupported</h3>

<p>Windows XP, 32-bit Windows Vista, 32-bit Windows 7</p>
