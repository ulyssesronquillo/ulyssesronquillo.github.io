<meta name="description" content="Here’s a list of companies that pay Microsoft for selling Android. As crazy as that may sound, these companies are willfully emptying their wallets as if Microsoft is holding a gun to their head. Velocity Micro, General Dynamics Itronix, Onkyo Corporation, Wistron Corporation and HTC head the list of companies that are paying Microsoft for their Android products. In addition, Barnes &amp; Noble, and Samsung are being sued by Microsoft on the same grounds that the Android OS infringes on Microsoft patents and companies who use the platform needs to pay up. Companies should really stop paying the Microsoft “tax” until the patent infringements can be proven in court. I don’t know exactly what these companies are thinking by letting Microsoft bully them into making deals. Let Microsoft sue Google, and let the courts decide the outcome. There’s no sense of paying Microsoft now for something that may not even materialize in the future. Crazy." />
