I accidentally short-circuited something on the motherboard. The computer kept running to my suprise, but immediately after powering down the system, the computer would no longer power up. I thought I had fried my power supply. Worse, I may have fried the motherboard. Then I searched online and <a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/upload/downloads/QA/PSU/PSU-Paper%20Clip-EN.pdf">came across this trick</a> to jump start the power supply. It was worth a try at this point in time. One, it was the cheapeast option. Frankly, I couldn’t tell what was preventing the system from powering up, either the power supply or the motherboard. It’s one or the other. So, the trick calls for getting a small paper clip and then removing the 24 pin connector from the motherboard, powering on the system and then placing the paper clip on pins 4 and 5. Pin 4 is the green wire. Pin 5 is the black wire. So I gave it a try. Sure enough the power supply turned on like the articles mentioned. The fans and the LED lights turned on. I turned off the power supply and reconnected the 24 pin cable back on the motherboard. There had been no problems ever since. Who knew a paper clip can jump start a power supply. Nice little trick. It saved me a few dollars.</p>]]></content><author><name>ulysses</name></author><category term="misc" /><category term="jump" /><category term="start" /><category term="power" /><category term="supply" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week ago, I was messing around with my motherboard trying to fix my RGB lights so that the RGB lights can all be controlled from one controller.

OpenWrt gives my router extensibility by providing features that you typically find only on high-end devices. It also gives me higher security since there are many added features. Firmware updates are published regularly which you’ll never receive on older routers since many hardware manufacturers no longer support their old routers. Performance is much better. Stability is another plus. And most of all, the price is right. OpenWrt is free. If you want to give an old router some life, give OpenWrt a try.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>printf -- '=%.s' {1..20}; echo
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Explanation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first I’m using printf instead of echo. printf is a little bit better when it comes to formatting.</li>
  <li>The – option tells printf to ignore the rest of the remaining arguments so it renders properly.</li>
  <li>The character before the % percentage is the one being repeated. In this case, we are repeating “=.”</li>
  <li>1-20 is the number of times the character before the % percentage is repeated.</li>
</ul>
