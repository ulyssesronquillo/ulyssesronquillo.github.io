<meta name="description" content="I recently switched to Comcast for my Internet services. It has been several years since I have left and abandoned Comcast. I was curious more than anything as to what kind of download speeds I’ll be getting now that I’m back to using broadband cable. The result is pretty impressive. It has been a while since I’ve seen this kind of speeds at home. It’s about 4-5 times faster than what I previously had. I ran 3 different speed tests from 3 different sources. I’m a little surprised the results were similar. All fell within the same range of one another. So, without much further ado, here are the results of the speed tests." />
