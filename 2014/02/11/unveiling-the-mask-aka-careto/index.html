    <p>PC World has a very interesting article entitled, “Unveiling ‘The Mask’: Sophisticated malware ran rampant for 7 years.” It’s also known as Careto, a sophisticated malware that ran rampant and undetected for 7 years. It has infected hundreds of government and private organizations in more than 30 countries. Kapersky Lab, an antivirus firm believes the virus could be state sponsored. Excerpt of the article from PC World:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When active in a victim system, The Mask can intercept network traffic, keystrokes, Skype conversations, PGP keys, analyze WiFi traffic, fetch all information from Nokia devices, screen captures and monitor all file operations,” the Kaspersky researchers said in the research paper. “The malware collects a large list of documents from the infected system, including encryption keys, VPN configurations, SSH keys and RDP [remote desktop protocol] files. There are also several extensions being monitored that we have not been able to identify and could be related to custom military/government-level encryption tools.”</p>
